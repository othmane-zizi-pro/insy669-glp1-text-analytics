This med is a game changer if you want to take control of your weight loss. You aren't starving yourself, you are just not eating as much as you did. This is more than likely how we are supposed to eat in the 1st place. Eat slow and stop when full. Don't over eat. I still drink beer but I drink low carb beer. I make sure I stay in ketosis most of the time. I follow the carnivore diet along with the injections. Works wonderfully!! Ignore all the negative reviews. They will stunt your growth. I know this isn't for everyone, but we don't need to hear your negative results. If you are wondering if you should do this, I am telling you that you should!! Thank you",5,2025-08-16,

And a general overall sick feeling for at least 2 weeks after the surgeries. It's something I feel like that. Has to do with the anesthetic and the ozempic combined? I'm not sure if I'm the only one. That's done this, but I thought y'all needed to know that it does do something with the anesthetic and ozempic together other than that. My A1C is great and I have lost quite a bit of weight on it but it was due to me being sick. When I was on it with my first surgery, I had been on it about 6 months and I lost 30 pounds in 2 weeks because of the combination of the surgery, and though zimbic, I believe I can't prove it. The doctors can't prove it but I know that it was a bad time for me. I was down 6 weeks with it.

Once I had intestinal pain with diarrhea and bleeding. At the hospital they found that I had something going on with my intestine, directly where I had given myself the shot. Stopped using my stomach and started giving my shots only in my thighs. However, the dizziness continued to come back. The ER Dr. sent me to a neurologist and what they told me was I had BPPV. Being that I had never had this issue before, I just didn't see how it just started happening out of the blue. I tried ear canalith repositioning as per the neurologist instruction when I had the episodes.

webmd_31,webmd,Ozempic,"Iâm 63 and was diagnosed with T2 diabetes 2-1/2 years ago. I immediately went on the carnivore diet and lost 25#, and lowered my A1C from 6.8 to 6 and lowered my triglycerides from 333 to 98. I had more energy and felt decent with exception to joint pain from arthritis. 

I didnât want to live this way indefinitely so I  transitioned to keto and then back to eating like a normal person and  slowly started gaining the wait back on. I gained 20lbs back on. 

My dietician told me that keto is the worst diet for diabetics and informed me that I should be eating 150g carbs every day. I donât understand this at all because my BS is good when I eat less carbs and I donât normally eat that many carbs in a day normally anyway. Not to mention youâre not going to eat that many on Ozempic anyway. Whateverâ¦

My A1C crept back up to 6.8 so doctor suggested Ozempic. This is the only medication I take. 

Iâve been on Oz since mid May and I continue to have the same symptoms plus more as I have titrated my dose up to 1mg.

 My negative symptoms are nausea, fatigue,  constipation, feeling âoffâ, and for the first time woke up in the night feeling like I would vomit so was cuddling the toilet for awhile until it subsided and came out the other end. Not diarrhea either, very hard ?? and crampy. Sorry for the TMI. 
The severe constipation concerns me the most because I wonder if itâs making me feel ill (toxic?)and could lead to a blockage. I started taking miralax to help so we will see if it helps. 

I wanted to note some positive side effects that Iâm noticing too. I have rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, I have had Lyme disease that has damaged my joints so Iâve dealt with a lot of inflammation for over 20 years but since taking Oz my inflammation has significantly reduced. My face and hands are no longer puffy. So this has been a pleasant surprise. 

My appetite is half of what it used to be and the longer Iâm on 1mg(this is my second month in 1mg) Iâm finally noticing that food noise quieting down. 

Iâm also down about 12-13lbs. I would like to lose 20-25 more and Iâm ok if it comes off slowly. Iâll admit that initially I was irritated that I wasnât losing as fast as some have. But Iâm severely insulin resistant (according to my doctor) so l should expect a slower loss. 

Some days I wonder if itâs worth the fatigue, constipation and feeling off every but some of your reviews have given me hope that in time these symptoms will subside. Iâm thankful that my doctor isnât titrating my dose up too fast either. I did .25 for one month, then a month at .5 and now  Iâll be on 1 mg for at least 3 months.",4,2024-08-27,

It's been really annoying this past week and I hope it is unrelated to the Ozempic as we are moving me up to the higher dose next week.

 I Started this journey in May.  It took time to get labs.  They weren't totally forth coming about the Ulta Labs and fees. Which was my 1 ??.  Then once I was finally approved  The man I spoke with Siad I was approved for the highest dosage 2.5mgs.  I was told to start with ""units"" the 1st week, then up it 10 the 2nd week & then up/down 5 units each week until I get to where I need to be.  I finally received the medication  2nd ??is when the syringes come and are 1cc syringes and only marked by 10 increments called ""units"" and the vial doesn't hold 2.5 mgs.  When I email the man that I was working with on the phone with questions like what is the unit considered to be, how long before I get to 2.5 mgs, and why I was told it was  5 weeks worth of medication but the vial says to discard any medication 28 days after the initial puncture.  I never received a response so that to me was another ??.  So I called person wouldn't answer questions and was transferring me to a supervisor and the call dropped.  So I made several calls and finally got a different supervisor who explained 1 unit so each increment of 10 on syringe is .25 so at that rate it will take months to get up to 2.5.  This is a big ??as so many reviews of various companies say this is how they take your $$ & you don't see the weight loss because the dose is so low.  I feel like I've been deceived as I was told on my initial phone call of being approved that I would be given 2.5mg within 4 weeks.  The supervisor also told me to disregard the label that says to discard medication after 28 days from initial puncture. This is another ??to me because why would they put it on the bottle if they didn't feel it was necessary?   Would you be concerned?  Has anyone else experienced this?  I'm left here totally confused. I thought I was finally getting help for my weight issues but it feels like someone failed to be open and honest with me from the start. So I'm not sure what to do at this point.   Do I continue and see how it works or switch to another provider and start all over?  I hate to start over but I'm concerned with transparency.  I'd appreciate any recommendations!  I want to like the company but I feel like something is off. I was told 2.5mg but that is months away.  I know from the research that it is less effective and even ineffective at such low doses such as .5 so why would they start me at .25 and increase it at 5 units after the 2nd week. ?

webmd_46,webmd,Ozempic,"I have struggled with binge eating and obesity since experiencing complicated trauma throughout my childhood and adolescence. I have been to therapy, seen a dietician, and tried many weight loss medications and diets over the years. I have lost and regained weight more times than I can count. I went on to further my education and am becoming a therapist myself because i thought becoming an expert would enanle me to get out of these cycles. Sure, ive learned alot but the physical aspect of hunger is hard. Also, I am pre-diabetic. The hunger urges and feelings associated with low blood sugar (even though I never read low) always do me in and I end up failing. Unfortunately, even pre-diabetic and with a BMI of 43, my insurance wouldn't cover gastric bypass. I lost, gained back, and lost again the same 30ish lbs multiple times over the past 5 years. After this last loss, I could feel myself wanting to quit and getting into a dark place of thinking, I'm never going to be able to maintain, so whats the point? Against my dietician's advice, I chose to try semaglutide through a local clinic at $500/month, out of pocket because, again, my insurance wouldn't cover it. After 7 months, I am down 43 lbs and am the lowest weight I've been since I had my 3rd child 13 years ago. More importantly, it has given me freedom from the constant obsessing over counting calories, macros, picking my diet plan, and weighing myself. I have never in my life felt ""normal"" around food before this. For the first time in my life I can walk away from food and not care. The weight loss has been very slow, which hurts given the cost of the medication. But, I truly feel free on it, and i feel like i can't put a price tag on that. While it has been ""life changing"" it only does part of the job.  I've had to choose to exercise, make healthy food choices, and be more overall active and health conscious. This just made it possible to start and maintain those habits. In the beginning months, I had some nausea, but I could live with it because I before I would often restrict and then binge until i was sick, so the type of nausea didn't make much of a difference. The worst part has been the constipation. I've had chronic bloat and diarrhea since I was a child. I thought constipation would be a reprieve, but really just a different variety of evil. I'm on maintenance now, so a shot every 2 weeks instead of weekly. I can tell when it wears off because my bowel habits go back to (my) normal and I'm hungrier. I have to work to keep the habits I've established. I also chose to switch to a whole food plant based diet a month ago which keeps me away from trigger foods (like cakes, donuts, muffins, and fast food.) I think this is also helping me to continue to lose .25-.5 lb/wk. Overall, I would recommend this to people who've struggled like I have. I'm 5'5"". My highest weight was 263. Starting on this med was 236. Currently 193.",3,2024-04-25,

webmd_89,webmd,Ozempic,"Just wanted to share my Ozempic journey with you all. I've recently started on my fourth round of Ozempic, this tiny 0.25 dosage. Honestly, admitting that I have diabetes still feels weird, but hey, here I am.

I used to be on Metformin (500 mg) for a solid two years, and it was great until it suddenly stopped working. No matter how well I ate, my sugar levels were sky-high after meals, often hitting the 200s or 300s. If you're dealing with type 2, you know how awful that feels.

I made it clear to my doc that I didn't want insulin. I was open to any other solution, be it a diet change, lifestyle tweak, or new meds. When Metformin lost its charm, my doc suggested Ozempic. With my blood sugar all over the place, and being a 53-year-old, 6'1"", 260-pound guy, I was game to try anything.

I'll admit, I was a bit of a chicken about starting Ozempic. I read tons of reviews, and that didn't help my nerves. The pen sat in my fridge for two weeks until one day, my sugar spiked to 450 after having a small piece of sourdough bread with chicken soup. That was my breaking point. I finally jabbed the Ozempic into my thigh and went to bed.

The next day started fine, but I felt sicker than ever. Zero appetite. Weirdly, Diet Dr Pepper was the only thing that didn't make me want to puke. By day two, I was feeling better. The sickness faded, and it hasn't come back since. My appetite is practically nonexistent now. I mostly survive on different versions of chicken soup and the occasional handful of nuts. And don't worry, my evening White Claws survived the Ozempic invasion.

But here's the kicker â my blood sugar levels normalized within a week, maybe a bit too low at times. After years of dealing with crazy high sugar, I feel amazing. I've lost about 5 pounds in the last month, which feels pretty good. I'm about to up my dose to 0.5 and hoping for the best.

Honestly, Ozempic has been a game-changer for me. I'm sleeping better, feeling calm during the day, motivated to move, and no more naps. If my first month can inspire anyone out there to take that first shot, go for it. Yeah, it's scary, especially after all the scary stories you hear, but it could change your life. Don't be afraid to take the plunge. Cheers to better days ahead! ??",5,2023-10-18,

webmd_104,webmd,Ozempic,"I also posted as caregiver for my DD. I am Carol, mother of Sue Anne. I too take ozempic and my reasons are a bit different. I have hypogycemia and was obese. The delayed digestion has been good for me. I used to get sick at my stomach and dizzy and have to eat all the time it seemed. I ended up at 195 and am about 5"" 8"". I am now at 148.  I have had side effects unlike my DD but have stuck with it and will. I also have very bad flat feet that have broken down over the years so I could hardly walk, was heading for a wheelchair. with weight loss, I can now get around so much better. By the way I am 77. My worst problem is constipation, I have always had a problem so nothing new. but it has been really bad, I have used Miralax, and enemas. I have worked on my diet to try to help and it has some. The main issue I had was overeating because of hypoglycemia and I also like to eat, LOL! and the wrong stuff. It got rid of a lot of cravings and I eat less, but most anything I want.  I can attest to the fact that if you eat to much you will get sick. In my case really sick, than I feel like I will vomit but don't. This has happened 4 or 5 times and I just quit eating to much, solved that problem. I also have gas, so I started taking a gas relief pill in the evening and stopped that. This is a good product, but like anything its no magic answer. You can't just take it and keep eating what you did and as much, it won't work and you will be sick. I too have never had to take more than .5mg per week. The last 2 months I've reduced to .25mg to help get rid of the constipation issue. I am still slowly losing some weight, hope to get to 145, but it has slowed down, which I expect. You have to work to make this medication work.

So ozempic was prescribed by our endocrinologist. It has been more than a year now and she weighs 125 and has a normal BMI and takes no other drugs for diabetes. She never had a shot larger than .50 mg and is still on it as her glucose and other levels are and have remained normal. This has been the best thing in the world for her. She has not had the side effects other than some constipation that others have had. We talked to the PA last week and they suggested she stay on that dose as it is serving her well.

Twice now Iâve had terrible diarrhea, which happened the two times I injected myself in the stomach instead of my thigh. Also had some mild nausea and horrible sulfuric burps. So far, itâs still worth it if the side effects can be managed but theyâre no joke. Iâm unlikely to increase my dose at this point bc I think the side effects would be unmanageable.

Dr B. said no relation (NR). then at month 23,  I experienced severe stomach pain that lasted 24 hrs.  nothing otc worked. I notified Dr.B. âNRâ. I did more research; it can effect & cause gallbladder, mood swings,liver, pancreatitis etc problems. I notified Dr.B, guess what; âNRâ. I shot off a serious portal message to him. He ordered bloodwork & ultrasound. Bloodwork was fine; However, the ultrasound found gallstones & the same Dr recommended gallbladder removal! more research, gallbladder is important. I told him i want the medication that helps rid the stones or laser treatment. Iâve been referred to Hepatology. He still denies any relationship. Pay attention to your body, ask lots of questions, get response in writing. Iâm off it for 3 weeks. My night munching has returned & craving sweets.

webmd_127,webmd,Ozempic,I started with the .25 dose for four weeks and am now on my third week at .5.  In that time span I have lost 15 pounds.  The first couple of weeks I did get mild nausea but nothing to severe.  It does seem to help control my appetite as I feel full after eating about half of what I used to at meals.  My concern is that my blood sugar numbers are out of whack.  I was on metformin and glipizide and my morning reading was usually between 120 and 140 and my A1c was at 6.8.  My doctor took me off the glipizide and now my numbers have ranged from 108 to 211 in the morning.  I have seen at least one review that said it can take up to 8-10 weeks for ozempic to start to control blood sugar.  I am wondering if anyone else has found this to be true.,4,2023-08-06,

I am on predisone for a week trying to calm down my joints and then will try mounjaro if I can get it.  There is still a shortage of mounjaro out there even though my insurance covered most of it.

On .5 I started having acid reflux on day of injection. Took 1 Prilosec with shot and had no reflux. Started 4th month on 1.0mg. The really bad side effects started 3 days later after first dose of 1.0 mg. Almost constant belching of foul sulfurous tasting gas. Extreme bloating and abdominal pain, but no vomiting or diarrhea. However, I had what I can only describe as âsplatter flatulenceâ, mostly mucus 10 to 15 times daily, usually triggered by eating 1 or 2 bites of anything. Day 3 & 4 I could make it to the bathroom, day 5 I couldnât. That night things got so bad I almost went to the ER, but couldnât get away from the bathroom. Iâve lost 23lbs some of which is due to side effects and not being able to eat.
   *GOOD NEWS!*  I found a cure for the side effects. One heaping Tsp. of Manuka Honey once or twice a day. Noticeable improvement immediately. By the 2nd day I was back to normal. I will not be taking Ozempic again. Google Manuka Honey for more info on healing properties. Itâs even being used with surgical dressings to prevent infection (per article, which I have read, in The Journal of American Medicine). It doesnât taste like regular honey but has an herbal flavor with sweet honey undertone. The taste may be off putting to some at first, but far better than the sulfurous burps which decreased immediately along with the other symptoms. I had some in my pantry that I had ordered from Amazon, but have since seen it in my grocery store. It is more expensive than regular honey, but I would pay triple for the healing effects.

webmd_141,webmd,Ozempic,"Ended up in ICU with my blood sugar around 400. Discharged with an A1C of 14. Weight 267#. Started taking Farxiga and using both quick acting and long acting insulin. I cleaned up my diet and eliminated all sugar and processed foods, with a focus on veggies and white meat chicken. Stopped drinking alcohol and limited drinks to coffee, unsweetened iced tea and water. 3 weeks after leaving the hospital I was prescribed Ozempic. Took .25 for 2 weeks, then .5 for 2 weeks, then 1mg for 3 weeks, and just started taking 2mg today. Only side affect I have had is mild constipation. 4 weeks into taking ozempic my A1C fell to 11.2â¦ at this time I stopped using my quick acting insulin with meals. 3 weeks later my A1C came back at 5.7â¦. My weight is currently at 224#.

To combat constipation I began consuming 2 cups of black coffee each day. Usually 1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon. I didnât like it black initially so I would add ice to it to cool it down so I could chug it fast. Over time Iâve come to like black coffe and enjoy it hot now. I also eat 1-2 sugar free greek yogurts each day. Iâve been doing this for 6 weeks or so now and I have little or no constipation. Oh, I also have found that if I fail to eat I become constipated so I feel that making sure I eat small food potions a couple times a day works.

For me, the weight loss has been gradual with some weeks showing nothing but have averaged 3-4 lbs per month. My cravings for sweets and snack foods has diminished although I do eat treats and lean into some mild cravings. I also seem to have lost my desire for red meat?!. Everyone has a different experience but all of my bad side effects were the direct result of eating greasy food/fast food/rich food/etc. Yes, there is some constipation but fibre made a big difference.

I literally could not eat anything for 3 days and like I mentioned I have lost 10 lbs in a week. By day 6 I started to get a little bit hungry but I'm still experiencing pretty bad cramping.

Seeing the number go down on the scale was exciting and I'm not sure that it's going to be worth all of this sickness that comes along with it or the triggering of my IBS. I have been unable to basically leave my house for days. I think that I will do today's injection as 0.25 mg and then in a couple days inject the other .25mg in hopes to ease some of the symptoms. I've been stuck at the same weight for so long that I'm just really hopeful that this will eventually subside and continue working on the weight loss and lowering my a1c. I can tell you that when I stopped the Rybelsus, I immediately gained weight back and I felt more hungry than I did before I started any of these medications. That is something I worry about, if I end up stopping Ozempic will I gain it all back. For now I just really need to work on the foods that I'm eating and changing my lifestyle and not just relying on the injection. I'm feeling very hopeful and excited at the possibilities of this medication can do for my overall health. Best of luck to everybody that's on it. I hope that you are able to succeed with whatever goal it is that you're reaching for.",4,2023-03-03,

Anytime I have stomach upset I use some Pepto and it goes away. I will probably stay at the 1 dose and work on my diet and exercise.

webmd_210,webmd,Ozempic,"I started out on 0.25 for 4 weeks. I had no side effects, lost a little weight. My first increase to 0.5 was fine, still no side effects and able to function as a normal person, at this point I was getting close to 30 pounds down. After 4 weeks, I was to increase my dose to 1mg. This is when the problems started...I've had bad reflux even with 40mg prescription Nexium, extremely painful stomach cramps, diarrhea (very bad, daily, about every 20-30 minutes, terribly disgusting sulfur burps, headache, weak/fatigue (likely from the inability to eat and barely drink liquids), if you do eat - you have to force yourself to eat because of the pain, dizzy spells (especially going from sitting to standing), stomach gurgles almost back to back all day, and did I mention how bad the diarrhea is? It's like giving yourself a virus that won't go away. I've taken the 1mg for 2 weeks now and can't tolerate this anymore. My doctor is putting me back down to the 0.5 dose as I had no side effects on that and took it for 4 weeks. However, the half life on this medication is very looooong, which means even though I have taken my 0.5 dose, it'll take a few weeks before anything balances out. My blood sugar levels have been so good it is unheard of. So far, I have lost 40 pounds but not without ridiculous amounts pain, did I mention the back to back diarrhea (don't leave home), and about 13 pounds of my weight loss came from the 1mg because you are so sick you don't want to eat or drink anything. Also, on the 1mg, you might want to just throw out your daily coffee or caffeine intake altogether as it makes it unbearable. Occasionally I will take ibuprofen for the stomach pain and does help (a little). I missed 2-3 days of work since going on the 1mg but thought I actually had a stomach bug until it was daily for the last 2 weeks. I am hopeful that going back to the 0.5 will stable me out. I love my BS numbers, and the weight loss is something I've never been able to accomplish (and haven not been this small since I was in my 20's (currently 38 years old). I'm actually able to fit into WAY smaller clothing and have even enjoyed shopping a little more. I have read in the comments about a lot of people feeling depressed after taking the medication. I have not noticed this, however, I have been on an antidepressant (Lexapro) for years. I could, however, see how this medication could make you depressed if you consistently experience the side effects that I have on the 1mg dose. Fingers crossed that going backwards will return me back to normal. Also, you may want to put 4-5 layers of underpants on when you go to sleep, trust me, to be on the safe side...did I mention diarrhea? If you can tolerate the smaller dose, stick to that, I personally do not recommend going to 1mg (the devil reared his head from the bowels of my stomach). Aside from wishing I never went to the 1mg (and perhaps being malnourished and dehydrated from upping the dose, I would recommend it but only to the level your body can tolerate it otherwise you will have zero quality of life.

I can barely bike 10 miles I am burping most of time. This stuff should not be on the market. Save your money if you want to take off weight just stop eating because thatâs all ozempic is going to do for you. Stock up on loperamide and adult diapers you will need them.

I've had hypoglycaemic symptoms (low blood sugar) since I was a teenager (I'm 52), but no medical tests would affirm this. Since taking Ozempic these lows are now gone, and I cried because now I finally know what just being hungry feels like. I am paying close attention to hunger cues now as my trigger to eat. I don't eat a lot in a day, but the food tastes better to me than pre-Ozempic. I feel so much better - arthritic knees don't hurt, inconvenience gone, congestion improved.

webmd_247,webmd,Ozempic,"I was in the pre diabetic range when I started to use this medication. It was given to me for two reasons. One to help me manage my sugars better and to help me lose weight. But personally it did not help me lose weight but it did help me bring my A1C from 6.0 to 5.9. My A1C was at 6.0 before I started Ozempic. I started to use this medication somewhere in July or August of 2021, and had to stop it July of this year because I have gallbladder stones and my doctor said Ozempic is known to cause that. 
Now here is where my worry and question comes in, I question how dependent does your body become on this medication. I say this because I stopped it like I said July of this year and my sugars were ok and my A1C in August was 5.9 but November came and my A1C spiked to 7.2. How and why did this happen in 2 or 3 months? I know I was in prediabetic range but I could probably expected a rise maybe of 6 or 6.1 but 7.2? So now they said I am diabetic.

I also have high cholesterol but has been unaffected by my weight loss or gain (I have weighed from 52kgs up to 70kgs with no chance, also have been vegan for 7 years with no change - so I'm not hopeful here). Relatively easy to use although the syringe system is a bit fussy and having to buy the higher doses as the lower ones are unavailable in my country, and then adjusting the syringe hasn't been simple. First time I took it, in the evening and could not sleep that night, also very badly for the following 5days. Have returned to normal now. Very strong appetite supressant effects the first five days (on 0.25) then fell to relatively normal appetite again, so I was quite stressed. On my second dose, no 'nervous feelings' but the appetite suppressant effect has stronly diminished - I just don't feel like snacking, but can eat otherwise normal meals. Had diarrhea the first couple of days, nothing since. No palpitations, no nausea, no constipation, maybe a little more gas than usual. Have taken my third dose now, same feeling - no side effects but only a minimal appetite suppressant effect, let's say 20% less which is still great, but not as reported by others (not being able to eat fatty foods, not feeling hungry at all).

I can't understand why I've been vomiting but I can only think it might be due to the food having a slow-release from the stomach and anything that hasn't had a chance yet to digest, goes bad and therefore you've no choice but to vomit. I've also noticed that my libido is now non-existant. I've read reviews on other websites and it looks like I'm not the only person experiencing this. This isn't listed as an official side effect so maybe the side effects list needs to be updated?

I am on my fifth week of using Ozempic. The first four weeks, I was on 0.25mg, and now I'm on 0.5mg. I will increase to 1mg in a couple of weeks and stay on that for the foreseeable. 

I have lost 14.5lbs so far and I am ecstatic about that! I have PCOS and so it's been very difficult for me to lose weight the traditional way but Ozempic makes it so easy for me. I have been feeling quite ill every morning. It starts in the early hours of the morning and lasts right through until about 10am. That's nausea, acid reflux, and an upset tummy. In the two days since increasing the dose to 0.5mg, I have been feeling these side effects a bit more.

I thought I was lucky because I hadn't had that side effect since I started taking Ozempic but I actually experienced this for the first time this morning. A bit embarrassing! But, I think taking everything into consideration, it's not enough to deter me from continuing to take Ozempic. Seeing the reductions on my scales is enough to make me want to continue. 

To try and reduce the side effects, my doctor advised that I eat as low fat as possible because it's the fat the exacerbates the side effects. She's right because I can see the difference between if I eat really low fat vs. a ""normal"" meal.

It is entirely possible to stay at the 0.5 mL dose for longer than a month if needed with no ill effect. My doctor agreed and prescribed me the 1.0 mL dose and recommended very incremental increased dosing. Just because you have a 1.0 mL pen, doesn't mean you have to use the entire 1.0 mL dose. From the 0.5 mL dose, I stepped up to 0.6 mL, then 0.7, 0.8, etc. This absolutely helped manage side effects and allowed a far more realistic adjustment period than the manufacturers recommended jumps of 0.25 to 0.5 to 1.0 mL.",4,2022-09-16,

I'm so pleased with this medication. I've lost approximately 35lbs so far. I've been on a strict diet and also go to the gym when I can, as well. But, I attribute most of the loss to this drug because nothing was moving the needle, until I started using it. I have barely no appetite and have to force myself to eat. I never really realized how much my life revolved around food until I didn't depend on it for comfort anymore. The only side effect I have is constipation, which I take stool softeners for. You can't expect to eat large meals with this and feel well. You really have to pretend like you just got bariatric surgery and can only digest small portions and nothing heavy. I feel this is why a lot of people report getting sick with GI issues. They continue to eat like usual. This MUST be a full lifestyle change to be effective and if you can power through some of the side effects and make the necessary healthy changes, you will be so pleasantly surprised.

OBGYN did ultrasound and said that I shouldnât be bleeding as my endometrial tissue was very thin. 
I have had very low blood pressure reading of 80s/60s, calf cramps, and a random frozen shoulder that I had to go to orthopedics for. Never these issues before starting medication. Very bizarre.

I have other issues related to auto-immune disease such as hidradenitis suppurativa, atopic dermatitis, and IBS.  I also have asthma, elevated cholesterol, and high blood pressure.

The first thing I noticed about taking Ozempic is that my IBS was immediately relieved but I started getting mood swings and irritability.  The effect of 0.25mg wore off within 3 days and I immediately got rebound diarrhea and felt lethargic.  After increasing to 0.5mg per week, the effect lasted 5 to 6 days and then began the IBS rebound and feeling bad.  On 1mg per week, everything seems normal and I only loose control of my appetite on the 6th and 7th days, no other effect noticed.

This medication actually makes me feel normal at a full dose.  I have a bowel movement every 36 to 48 hours and have good control over my eating habits.  The only thing I have a hard time giving up are the grains, especially wheat, that seem to cause a lot of inflammation in my body.  I notice that I feel good when I especially avoid wheat. But sadly, I like bread a lot.

The hardest thing to get over is psychological dependency on eating as a way to find happiness in life and to deal with my emotions.  I am free to enjoy other things now besides eating.  My whole life seemed to revolve around eating and the planning of meals.

webmd_301,webmd,Ozempic,"I havenât been on Ozempic long, but Iâm not thinking itâs doing anything for me, beside the constipation, headaches, nausea, dizziness, and exhaustion.

Iâve been on it long enough to take 5 once-a-week doses now,  four at 0.25 and one at 0.5. Each week, Iâve had different side effects. The first week, there was mild nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, and exhaustion, Second week brought stronger nausea to the point of vomiting. Doc prescribed something for it, but it didnât really help. Third week, the nausea went away, but there was severe constipation. Fourth week, I had sharp abdominal pains (probably due to the continuing constipation) and some dizziness. Fifth week (upped dose to 0.5), I had the first migraine that Iâve had in years, along with more nausea again, and still with the constipation.

The reason that Iâve stuck it out this long is because the doc and my mom (who has been on this med for a while) told me that the side effects would dissipate and the weight loss would be worth it. I was also told that I would lose interest in eating and I would feel full almost all of the time. Neither has been true for me. I still have the same late-night snacking urges that helped me put on the weight. The only thing that Iâve noticed is that I canât eat as much, because I start feeling nauseous after eating about half of what I used to. The bad thing about that, though, is that I had a sleeve gastrectomy, so I was already eating about half of what a non-sleeved person eats.

I plan to try to stick it out until my next A1c (which was 9.3 at my last appointment), to see if it makes any change there. If it makes enough of.a difference there and I do actually see a dissipation of side effects, then Iâll stay on it.

I missed 2 weeks of work, couldn't drive because I was so dizzy, didn't do anything around my house. At the end of 2 weeks, my husband took me to the hospital.

Iâm insulin resistant, obese on glycemic chart, always showed high glucose on blood work. Diabetes is hereditary in my family. I did ALL the diets . Started WW at age 12. Lost weight yes slowly plateaus for months and months then Iâd eat and gain back the weight. A friend told me about metabolic clinic through our hospital and she had tremendous success. I was psyched!
I qualified for the rx and my insurance paid for a lot of it but I paid $190. A syringe which lasts 6 weeks.
Painless injection. 
So nauseous like most here. Urge to eat gone. Maybe too gone. I couldnât eat. Was losing weight like crazy and that felt great. My dx prescribed zohran which is a life saver for me.( 4 mg maybe once a day or 5 days out of 7).
After a month I was supposed to go up to .50 but .25 was working and finally I was able to eat a little because not eating isnât the way i
Wanted to go. My doctor said if 2.5 is working stay on it so thatâs what I did itâs been about almost 3 months and Iâve lost 22 pounds I feel great weight wise but the nausea continues here and there. My doctor said to watch the carbs and sugar because that could activate the nausea and when I did that I less nausea but the thing is I really donât want to give up things like watermelon, blueberries and some other fruit. So Iâve been staying on .25 and it still helps me to tell me when Iâm full Iâm still eating a fraction of what I used to eat and the good part other than the weight loss is that my blood pressure medication has been cut in half and then actually then cut in half again so for me thatâs fabulous to have those meds tapered my heart doctor is thrilled with weight loss and sheâs OK with this Way to go to lose weight Iâd to have questioned whether I wanna keep living like this in order to stay sinner or less fat and I donât know how long I can do this itâs a nausea doesnât ever subside . Many days I feel just fine so I really have to probably start watching what Iâm eating to see what the reaction is and Iâm finding that if I eat watermelon at night and I feel fine I donât feel fine the next morning I am so thankful for this medication and somebody finally addressing the fact that we overweight people need some help as well I plan on going back to Weight Watchers only to get the camaraderie and Iâd like to listen to the strategies of a diet plan. sometimes though Iâm so tired I canât exercise itâs weird I have normal days and then days where Iâm just really tired.

One thing I donât understand is the pen clearly states that after six doses even if you have more medication left in the pen you must throw it out I donât understand why especially since it cost so much money why thatâs something that you have to do it makes me feel like maybe the company is just trying to get more money out of us and of course thatâs not right.",5,2022-07-28,

Each dose I experienced some stomach knots, but they resolved after the first day of the adjustment. I did initially have some very mild nauseum but all I needed to do, was take a sip of cold water to take care of it. I stress, the nauseum was very very mild.

I have had no problem doing that even though I used to be a carb addict. I have lost 20 lbs in the past 6 weeks.

webmd_330,webmd,Ozempic,"My mother started taking Ozempic for her T2 Diabetes about 2 yrs ago and had a tremendous weight loss as a side effect with little effort, along with an excellent result in her A1C being lowered. I approached my weight loss doctor about the possibility of using Ozempic/Wegovy for weight loss (I have a BMI of 38, 240Lbs at 5' 4""). I have been on it for 4 months now with tremendous results. I have tried many other plans, including every diet imaginable, WW, Gastric Banding, Gastric Bypass, etc, with temporary success. But nothing would ever remove the feeling of being ""hungry"" and wanting to binge. Ozempic has done the trick. 

Yes, there are side effects that can be uncomfortable. If you are nauseous, ask your doctor for Zofran (an anti-nausea medication that really works). If you have gas, use simethicone 250mg. 

I realize I may need to remain on this for the rest of my life, but that is a small price to pay to reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes & stroke, which all run in my family. Thank you, Novo-Nordisk!",5,2022-07-18,

After consulting with my dr a few minutes ago, we have decided I will no longer take this drug, as it is no way to live, even though I have seen some success weight loss wise, but the matter at hand regarding the amount of pain really is just unbearable. I am still laying in my bed, my husband had to take the day off of work to watch the kids, as I am in no way capable of doing so because of the aftermath of what I went through, my body is exhausted, and my stomach is still very sore, and my energy is depleted, I hope others have a more pain free experience, as I would not wish this on my worst enemy.",3,2022-07-18,

Besides the occasional bout of nausea and fatigue when moving up a dose, itâs been fine thus far, apart from my most recent dose change. I took the .5 for 5 weeks, since on the fifth week I didnât have access to the 1 mg pen yet, and I took my first dose of 1 mg just the other day and I have been violently ill since. I just wish there was a .75 mg marking instead of it being strictly a 1 mg pen, because doubling your dose like that really sucks. Iâve gagged countless times, canât stay fully upright for long due to stomach problems, appear to have gastroparesis, and nearly all the contents of my stomach are liquefied, but havenât passed on to the intestines yet. Iâve also had gas pain through the roof and also have burped a lot more than normal, despite me having GERD regardless of the Ozempic. Because of the nausea, that burping nearly makes me throw up every single time. Iâve been stuck in a recliner unable to move because of surgery before, and had a laparoscopic gallbladder removal, but nothing has ever really affected me this bad, apart from COVID-19. Iâm seriously considering going to the emergency room if this doesnât let up. The 1 mg pen also isnât near potent enough; because of the sheer volume of the 1 mg dose, it pooled in the injection site and was extremely uncomfortable.

I did have side effects when I started but the ability to turn away food and know when my body was full far outweighs any discomfort. It is an injection which is a little unnerving but the needle is super small. 
I just had my lab work done and all my levels were fine. I have been doing a .5 ml but will be switching to the 1 ml next week. I still exercise everyday and eat right, itâs not a miracle drug, but Ozempic has given me that little extra boost to get my weight loss journey started.",4,2022-06-21,

I started with the usual .25 dose for 4 weeks and it didn't do anything in terms of weight loss or for hunger. I felt mild symptoms, mostly just tiredness but nothing too terrible. When I increased the dose to .50, the tiredness increased as well and I felt a little discomfort at times, but again nothing major. I did not lose any weight and it did not help with hunger. I am now on my second week at the 1.0 dose and my hunger is completely gone. I have no cravings for food and I find that I am for needing my tell myself to eat. I started a low calorie diet(Noom) on June 01/22 as well, and I am happy to say that in since then(17days ago) I have lost 13lbs. I think the combination for Ozempic at 1.0 dose and the low cal diet is the magic wand and is working for me. I have bouts of dizziness, still very tired but the lbs are melting off almost effortlessly.

First four weeks 2.5 now using.5.  Only problems I experienced at .25 was moderate bloat and foul burping.  Did not lose weight or experience any nasty nausea or constipation.  Past four weeks at .50, drastically different effects and results.  So nauseaus, throwing up frequently, like 2-3x per day, bad constipation which leads to more vomiting.  Or if i begin to heat up and start sweating.

I've read enough of these reviews to know what can occur so I'm roughing it out until my follow up next week with my Dr.  I've lost ~15bs these past four weeks.  My blood sugar went low for the first time in my life so I've discontinued Humalog 20 units x2 daily and I'm testing good range glucose-normal for 2 weeks now. Dr also took me off Januvia to start so I'm taking .50 ozempic and Jardiance only now.  Honestly I don't think I can keep this up unless the nausea and tiredness subsides which I hate to think of stopping since it is working.

As others previously mentioned, I have that ""weird"" feeling in my tummy. lol, it's not even something you can identify with to be honest, it's just weird. The feeling of not needing to eat is there, the mental part is the difficult part- I KNOW that Nanaimo bar tastes good... do I really want it-- or just recall that it tastes good.. weighing in whether to tackle it or not...yet side tracked in any way takes me away from the memory of good food. So that's good!
Gas-- yes biggest gassy noises ever- glad I can go outside quickly to pass. Needle is not worth mentioning- simple, no pain, just sit on skin, press button, count and release. Simple. 
I do not know of it's effectiveness yet, however I know my daughter lost 16lbs in two weeks. The cost is not covered for me, but it is so important for me to take the weight off my knees that it's worth scrimping for- plus I will buy less goodies! Win-win. I will touch base as my body decides what it's going to do..

I am on my 4th week now. It has been a life changer.  My fasting level has been 5.00 or lower ( I am in canada) and after meals I never go over 8. And for me that's miraculous . I don't have the huge spikes anymore,4,2022-04-25,
webmd_381,webmd,Ozempic,I am in my second week of using ozempic and still at 0.25 mg dose and the results have been nothing short of miraculous. Itâs like someone turned a switch on in my brain that was accidentally shut off. I now feel full after eating even half a sandwich or a small bowl of oatmeal. I canât actually believe it because itâs so strange to just be able to walk away from food because Iâm full. I donât think Iâve felt this since I was a child. Iâve lost about 7 lbs. I have definitely experienced some vomiting but mostly at night which is similar to what I had from reflux. Definitely had some constipation and the burps are miserable- but again with my weight gain I had terrible reflux so I was sort of used to it- Iâm praying it keeps working because I finally feel like I can have a normal relationship with food.,4,2022-04-24,
webmd_382,webmd,Ozempic,"I was on the trial for Ozempic.   Took one injection at LMC and took the second at my home.  Really back diarrhea and then stomach pains.  Stopped taking the injection because I felt worse than ever.  Two weeks or so later I broke out into a rash and welts all over my body.  Doctors at LMC said it was psoriasis and had nothing to do with the Ozempic.   I am 73 years old.  Psoriasis at my age?  Really?  Then my family doctor referred me to a dermatologis who said not Psoriasis but performed a biopsy to be sure.  Lab came back with not psoriasis and could not rule out Ozempic.   After 72 years of no allergies, I now have an allergy to semiglutide.

I thought once my breakout cleared up after medicating topically for more than 3 months, I actually have a worse reaction to Ozempic.  My Thyroid started failing.  Their list of side effects said Thyroid tumors or cancer.  They didn't say anything about Thyroid slowing down.  I now have to take medication to try and fix my Thyroid. 

What did Ozempic do for me?  It slightly lowered my blood sugar. It gave me an allergy to semiglutide.   Affected my Thyroid Stimulating Hormone and put it higher than it should be which now caused me severe weight loss; muscle loss; fatigue; extreme difficulty climbing stairs.  No strength at all.  Also, the Thyroid issue causes problems with swallowing.  Not just food, but water as well.

This was the worst experience I ever had with a drug.  It looks like I'm going to being paying for it for as long as I live.",1,2022-04-24,

Lost 25 lbs which was every bit of my excess fat, the medicine has taken away my urge to eat all the time and when I do I feel full very quickly!  A great thing!

The stomach ache and vomiting is unusual but I didn't link it to the meds because again I hadn't read any reviews or any info at all really,  but by the 4th day after dose increase (today) severe cramping in my stomach and vomiting almost immediately after eating,  burps that smell and taste rotten  i decided to look for some answers,  im not sure about weight loss yet but I haven't even tried to eat again,  im actually scared to so yeah im sure weight-loss would follow so I guess the question is weather or not I can handle this and of course how long it lasts , I know if I can lose weight and keep it off I would like to be able to hang in there but I guess time will tell, I will try to remember to update my progress on here and hopefully help someone with my story but in the end its up to the individual and what weight-loss is to them as in any diet witch is why some work well for certain people and yet not at all for others Good luck to all of u and God  bless",4,2022-04-21,

As of April 13, 2022, Iâm down to 298lbs.Iâm so excited for the future as my doctor has been amazed and excited by my results. A low carb diet really is the difference paired with working out consistently.

I started over 300 pounds and I am down about 7 pounds. Before taking this I had severe swelling in my legs for over a year that limited how I could move. The swelling in my legs has been gone now for about a week, and I feel so much stronger. I was able to stand on my feet so much easier for activities. I eat smaller portions because I feel fuller.

webmd_398,webmd,Ozempic,"I have other complicated health issues that impacted my ability to walk, sleep, breath and resulted in being put on large doses of steriods. The steroids made me insulin resistant. I was on weight gaining medicine prescribed by a couple of my specialist for my other conditions that were helping me walk again and I didn't realize it. So my doc put me on Metformin and Ozempic for three and a half weeks. So my internist doc put me on Metformin for two weeks then added Ozempic.  Had to come off all insulin.  it was in three days of taking this Metformin I lost 3 lb. My doctor recommends .25mg  for the first 4 weeks and then I'll go up .5 mg for another 4 weeks then if needed the 1 mg. Which I think has helped with the manageable symptoms. She has found the combo helps to not need to go to high on the Ozempic. I think the slow dosing is the way to go for me. I am probe to whatever severe side effects are in meds.  But I've only had some nausea bloating, headache, constipation but all mild and tolerable. I take daily probiotics and eat a diet full of  foods that help with digestion like kimchi, cabbage, onions or yogurt etc. I also recommend magnesium supplement on occasion. I also significantly increase my water and got one of those 2.2 L bottles. I realize when I don't drink enough water the constipation occurs.  I have been eating paleo since 2011. So while while trying to lose weight, I've been keep my carbs moderately low like around 70 g and my proteins between 80 and 100; high in good fats. 5'11 and started at 340. I have noticed when I eat I really rich dish and I really have upset stomach afterwards. I had a decrease appetite and full wicked fast immediately after taking Ozempic. I get all my carbs from fruits, nuts and vegetables. If I eats sweets it's not with cane sugar  but paleo and keto kind when I have a craving. I can't tolerate most of the sugar substitutes so I use coconut sugar but don't really have a sweet tooth now. Gluten gives me inflammation. So when I do make a sweet it's usually with a nut flour/butter. So in three weeks I am down to 328 at my last weigh-in. Again I think so and study those wins the race. Changing my diet. Getting my body moving in some way. for me it was just minimal walking.

Other than a little nausea and some constipation (nothing some raw probiotics can't fix) I feel fine. I do think starting on a lower dose has a huge impact on how severe your symptoms can get.
The scale fluctuates. I can't get a real reading on my weight loss. I'll be down 3 kgs 1 day, then up again in 2 days.
It's definitely helped with portion control. I get fuller much quicker now. Over all water retention has dropped I don't feel so 'puffy'. - my legs, ankles and feet were becoming so swollen for over 3 months - that's stopped now.

Only eat half of what youâre used to.  Even if you still feel hungry, stop eating. In about 5â10 minutes youâll feel super full and if you keep going youâre going to feel so bloated and nauseous. I was an emotional eater, I craved things relentlessly.

Despite all this I would highly recommend ozempic. I have pcos and have tried many 'diets' over the years and can honestly say this is the most effective thing I have tried. I did not change my diet (I followed the guidance by my supplier to continue eating as normal), the idea of this is to your train your brain to eat smaller portions of your usual meals, so I never ever felt deprived or that I was dieting - ozempic massively reduced my appetite so it has been so easy to adjust to eat smaller portions.

Cons: donât over eat or youâll pay. Crazy stomach pain, gross burps, vomiting. It was crazy. 


Yes, some times it was really bad. But the goal is to loose the weight and get off it and maintain. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who is obese and their weight is a concern to their health.

Iâve done 0.25mg for 2 weeks, then 0.5mg for 2 weeks. So far Iâve lost about 2kg, but I didnât expect to lose much while I was weaning on. 

Iâve had pretty minimal side effects, just a little nausea & slugishness, kind of like an early pregnancy feeling. But itâs eased as times gone by. 

I inject into my thigh which a lot of people say reduce side effects. 

Itâs interesting because I have always struggled with eating, very much an all or nothing kind of eating disorder. But Ozempic has been able to help me regulate eating at a more appropriate balance. For example I can have a snack sized chocolate bar once a day and be satisfied, in the past if I was on sugar Iâd eat a whole Block of chocolate and thatâs all id want all day. 

I crave healthy foods too like fruit and veg.

In addition to the medication, I've walked 4 miles daily no exceptions.  The side effects have gone away and my energy has increased considerably.

webmd_427,webmd,Ozempic,"I started this medication 6 months ago after I had gained about 50 lbs from medications I was on to treat my chronic pain. I was eating very healthy, exercising and doing everything I could but couldnât lose a pound. My dr suggested Ozempic and I was pretty skeptical at first but decided to give it a try. I was 190 lbs. I started at the 0.25 dose for the first 2 weeks but let me tell you that the day I did my injections I thought I was going to literally die that night. I was up all night with diarrhea, vomiting and severe sweating and abdominal cramping from hell. I decided to stick it out and see if it would get better and it did. I was actually terrified when I had to increase to my 0.5 dose but surprisingly it was much better. Within the first 2 weeks I had dropped 13 lbs.I had no appetite really and found I had to remember to eat at times, I had zero cravings and normally Iâm a chocoholic! I couldnât believe it! I continued to drop weight and at times it would plateau for a few weeks and Iâd be puzzled as to what was going on and then all of a sudden it would drop suddenly again. Iâve been on the 0.5 now for about 5 months and am down 38 lbs. Iâve just recently started experiencing some issues with low blood sugars, shakiness, excessive fatigue, sugar cravings and hunger again so after seeing my dr yesterday heâs suggested dropping back down to the 0.25 to see if it helps. I have found the pens very easy to use. My dr actually suggested I purchase the 2ml pens and taught me how to count the clicks(18 is 0.25 ml) and (36 is 0.50ml) and I just mark it with a sharpie. I have no coverage and this has helped with cost so just a little tip thatâs helped me. Hope this is helpful information. I would highly recommend this medication",5,2022-02-09,

webmd_431,webmd,Ozempic,"I have type 2 diabetes and started taking ozempic 1 year ago. I started at the .25 dose and over a few months went up to 1 mg dose. At first there were no side effects but lost about a pound a week. After starting the .50 dose I began having major constipation which increased as the doses were increased. I tried many products and tips to ease the constipation but, unfortunately, it began to affect my mental health and decided to go off of the ozempic. My hunger was ravenous when I came off of it and I sadly gained most of my weight back. After a few months I decided to give it another try after my weight loss/diabetic Dr. contacted me with an idea of a drug to help with the constipation. I found it difficult to take because it was an hour before each meal and my work schedule made it very difficult to do so. I am now trying lactulose to try and help. So far, so good. I have lost a few of the pounds I gained back and my hunger is decreased significantly. I do like this product for its positive side effects of weight loss and lowering my A1c levels. I am crossing my fingers that I can stay on it with minimal side effects, as I was able to go off of Metformin and lose significant weight.",4,2022-01-29,

webmd_433,webmd,Ozempic,"My Dr suggested Ozempic about 7 months ago, for obesity.  I had tried everything to lose weight.  I had gained a lot off additional weight during the first few covid lock downs.  My weight 10 months ago was 270 pounds.  I lost the first 30 pounds on my own and then in July, at 240 pounds, started with ozempic.  I've lost at a steady rate of close to 1 pound per week.  I'm now down to 196 pounds.  

I started with .25 and gradually increased dosage.  Amazingly, I almost immediately felt full after a few bites during a meal.  I had never experienced that feeling before.  In the past I could eat endlessly, and not realize it until much later that I was too full.  
I do burp, occasionally constipated  and experience some fatigue.  I also experienced heart burn. I've now become aware that my fatigue is related to my sugar levels dropping to low.  And the rest of the symptoms can be managed by eating less at one sitting.  

With ozempic, the food in my stomach is very slow to digest.  Hence the burping and heart burn.  It stays in your stomach much longer,  helping you feel full longer.  
My Dr warned me that rich, or oily foods could cause upset stomach and diarrhea.   So I was very careful initially with what I ate.  Now, my meals are do small, a few bites of something rich doesn't impact me.  Surprisingly though, I have very little interest in the desserts and snacks that I did in the past.  

I'm so pleased with how this has worked for me!",5,2022-01-12,

webmd_441,webmd,Ozempic,"I have been taking this for about 7 weeks for obesity . After trying a calorie restricted diet of under 1200 cals for many years that had stopped working despite strict adherence, and daily exercise for 3 hours/8-9 kms walking for nearly a year now that did not result in significant weight loss. 
The first week was rough, in bed with migraine, nausea, heartburn and fatigue the third day. Constant nausea.  The second week I reduced the dose from 20 pen clicks to 17 (less than the starting dose of 0.25) and that reduced the side effects. At 6 weeks on the reduced dose, I still have a lot of burping, mild crampy abdominal pain, heartburn at times managed by Tums, and low grade nausea.
However, my previously constant ravenous hunger that distracted me so much I was actually misdiagnosed with ADHD at one point, is now a more normal hunger at mealtimes. I have not changed my low calorie diet and am still exercising 3+ hours daily. But after a year of no weight loss on that strict regimen, adding Ozempic even at this low dose, has resulted in a steady 1 lb per week loss or more. After 6 weeks, I am down almost 10 lbs and no longer in the obese category. But the miracle is that I am not tortured by hunger 24/7 anymore. My hunger used to wake me up at night, now I can sleep through and wait for a light breakfast. I am going to try going back to the 0.25 dose this week and hope the severe side effects do not return. I wrote this so others who may be more sensitive to the side effects can know that you do not have to start at 0.25 but the pen can deliver a smaller dose with fewer clicks and it still works.",4,2021-11-29,

Having struggled with my weight dâor zither best part of four decades decided I needed help and this seemed the crutch that could help me.  Started out well.  Some sleep issues and gas but nothing unbearable.  After 18lbs loss in 3 months and 2 progressions from 0.25 to 0.75 I started to experience a really negative side effect:  major hair loss.  I have a big mane and it was coming out from the root in clumps.   I went to see my dermatologist thinking it must be something to do with stress or some allergy and he asked me what I had started doing two to three months ago.   I told him I had started ozempic and he looked it up.  There they were - reviews of others who had experienced severe hair loss.  Nowhere on the box or on ozempicâs site was it mentioned.  So fat and hairy or slim and bald?   That was Sophieâs choice.  I had started to flatline and was feeling strangely âlowâ in mood  anyway so decided to come off it and try the old fashioned boring way, again.   My weight doctor wants to explore other options but I am inclined to forget the miracle aids for now.  I should mention that my dermatologist did say there was a chance that the body would adjust and the hair loss would cease.   Then again, there was a chance it would continue.

I anticipate my A1C is dropped to normal range based on my random reading. I feel great and energetic even though that I have reduced my eating. So give this a try but only inject into thighs and it works. I hope Ozempic would be covered with my insurance, but it is not.

I was 315lbs, now I am 303.  I find my appetite is not like it used to be.  no cravings, when I eat, after I eat 1/2 my usual portion, I am full.   Digestion is slower. I took a couple wks for the medicine to kick in to get my brain on board with the size of my portions and the first week I ate too much and it gave me the runs, and one day that I totally pigged out on mcdonalds and pizza i had both runs and nausea.  Have not had a recurrence since.  I am not hungry, I eat what I want, although, when I eat too much sugar, my glucose spikes...duh.  It doesn't stop you from making stupid decisions if you make them with smaller portions.   Overall i like how it is helping me with my weight and that can only have a positive affect on my a1c and blood pressure.   I have had to use prune juice a couple times but i am getting used to only 1x/day BM instead of my normal 2 when I ate too much.

I have tried weight watchers and others but I always felt hungry and so sabotaged my diet or program.  I am so excited to be in the 200's soon.  I have a needle phobia so at first I delayed taking because I was afraid of sticking myself.  I put mine in the flab that is under my arm.  alternating one arm one week and the other the next. just put my arm on table with flab rolled forward and stick it press, hold and done. I don't feel it at all.  i picked arm cuz reviews showed those who use in belly have more GI issues.  could be imaginary, but i figured its easier in my arm anyway and I can do anywhere. I then shake my arm, pat the fat and do some air punches to get it not to stay in one area cuz I fear it will hurt if it doesnt dissapate...thats my own hypothesis.   Anyway.... good luck.

webmd_470,webmd,Ozempic,"It has been a year ago since I started taking Ozempic. It was the final solution to a never ending problem with my blood sugar. I was already taking Metformin, Gliclazide and Invokana, but no matter how I tried to eat better, exercised, nothing was happening. My blood sugar was still rising. At one point my blood sugar went up to 11 and it has never been that high before. So my G.P. referred me to an Endocrinologist. The first thing he did was order a blood test and review all my medications. Finally, because I was taking the maximum dosage on all the other meds, he asked me to try Ozempic. At first I was hesitant because he explained that I had to inject myself once a week (and I hate needles), but that this was not insulin. He said try this medication or Iâll start you on insulin. I would rather try other medication before submitting to a life of insulin everyday.    He was very candid about the side effects of this medication, 3 to 6 weeks of uncomfortable side effects, but it will all go away eventually. He said if the side effects doesnât go away after 6 weeks, to give him a call and he can change it to something else.  Well, I persevered, but I will be brutally honest to whoever will be reading this review, you will be miserable and sick and wished to God it would end. I had nausea, vomitting, headaches, lightheadedness, diarrhea, and so many other physical discomfort that I kept telling myself it will be all worth it. I was ILL, so ill that at one point I couldnât get out of bed. So if you are willing to risk taking this drug, then make sure to take a leave of absence from your workplace because you will end up calling in sick A LOT! I was fortunate enough to be off work, so all the horrible side effects didnât affect my job.     Ozempic is my saving grace. The journey was not easy, but my results are shown on my blood test and urine test. To date my A1C is 5.2 and Iâve lost 39 lbs.My diet went from CRAP to healthy.",5,2020-08-07,

webmd_483,webmd,Ozempic,"Having read many threads on this forum I havn`t read any from users who also suffer with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) so I thought it might be helpful to share my experience as I have had IBS since my late teens. I am 64 now. I started as most people do with a weekly injection of .25 mg to start my body to get used to Ozempic. I thought at first that I had no side effects. This was not quite correct though as I believed I was experiencing low level IBS which was not unusual for me. However I began to notice this was happening more often than usual. What actually seemed to be happening was that I was not having a direct side effect, but the Ozempic was actually triggering IBS events. This became much more obvious when I moved on to the next dosage level of 0.5 mg. The effects began between 24 and 48 hours and these were high level (severe) IBS events which lasted for 3 - 4 days when I got very severe stomach cramps constant diarrhea with fecal incontinence when sleeping requiring making a nappy out of a bath towel for at least 2 nights. On the 3rd week of the 3rd month the effect happened only hours after the injection. when I started the 4th month I had no IBS reaction, other than a few sulphur burps and this is how it has remained. It was a very unpleasant 3 months but I pushed on because of the promised benefits. Four months on and no unpleasant side effects. The results seem to be very good and I am really pleased that I stayed with it, I was getting near to the point of wondering if all effects were going to be worth it. So my advice if you also have IBS is stay with it as long as you can, for me it was hugely successful in the end, even though it was a very unpleasant road getting there.",5,2019-09-25,

I looked like a skeleton and had no energy or quality of life.  The loss of quality of life is a price I am not paying.

webmd_514,webmd,Wegovy,"So the upside is the appetite is definitely more manageable. .5mg helped me maintain weight. 1 mg helped me lose.

One thing you have to learn about this medication is you should eat before you're hungry. I realized I could go half a day without eating and not notice it. Then when I was a little too behind on calories, I'd be hungry at night and couldn't sleep because I didn't eat enough. But you don't want to eat in the middle of the night because it can mess up your sleep a lot more because it may or may not cause nausea.

I am taking this with an SSRI because I have depression. So major factors I look for are hydration, mineral (salt/other electrolytes) intake, and quantity to avoid nausea symptoms. It's better to eat four 400 calorie meals or five 300 calorie meals a day to avoid all these aspects, and make sure you get fluids with foods. You will be generally full between 200-300 calories.

Avoid carbonated drinks, alcohol, too much marijuana, and some other drugs that mess with gastric emptying because they could actually be the things causing the side effects. Leafy greens really curb my nausea, I find. If the first day shot is really bad because of work stress or whatever/being too busy, I follow the BRAT diet for a day and a half, and eat my calories the same way. Make sure you get protein, because it's easy to lose muscle. Lower fats and less extremely sweet sugars (or sugars taken in very small bits) help avoid nausea, too, so lean proteins are great for this. Leave the last meal at least 3 hours before bedtime. It took a little nuance to figure this out. I definitely had to quit alcohol at 1 mg.",4,2025-09-09,

During a trip to Iowa, I had extreme trouble peeing on my driving trip out there. So, not only do you pee too much on Wegovy, you also can have major difficulties in peeing at certain times.

webmd_529,webmd,Wegovy,"I was prescribed wegovy to help with weight loss due to chronic injuries of my legs. I have not been able to shift my weight due to not being able to move without pain. Prior to taking it I had just tried the svelte diet plan and had actually lost 2kg in the 11 days detox. I decided to keep following the food suggestions within this diet plan whilst taking wegovy.

I kept losing weight by small amounts whilst taking 0.25 and 0.5 amounts. I had a small amount of nausea and tiredness but that was only in the first two days of taking the injection. I've just completed my 4th injection of 1.0 and at this dosage the weight has been falling off. I have been waking up in the night with indigestion but have found sleeping on my left side eases this.  

I am no longer waking up and walking in pain, im no longer limping and feeling so much lighter. My belly has gone and i can see down there again. I've lost 12kg so far and am so thankful for wegovy in helping me shift this weight off.

The only complaint i have is the shock of finding out as the dosages go up the price goes up by a ridiculous amount! I'm in Australia and the doses from 0.25 to 1.0 were $260 per month. I filled my first script for 1.7 it has gone up to $380!!

I have suffered from chronic back pain for years so at first I did not think much of it accept that the severity of my pain was way too high with no discernable cause AND my blood felt like and still feels like it is literally on fire causing my entire body to be in extreme pain if I don't take more of my prescribed pain meds than normally needed for my normal amount of back pain!!

Had ice cream the other day, my all time favourite food, had about 4 bites and i was fine with that and gave the rest away.  Not because I was trying to have will power but because I genuinely just didn't want it.

I also work at Sonic and deliver 200 or more orders a day so that may have what helped me a little too. I started eating yogurt, nuts, and straight protein and drinking a ton of water a day! On average I would lose 7-12 pounds in a month which does lead to saggy skin (not much) but hey it does work. However, weening off I feel awfulâ¦. Yes, itâs expensive but it IS worth it!

My side effects are minimal (occasional nausea) now.  I did have a lot of nausea to start with - but 'morning sickness' home remedies worked. 

The benefits are amazing!  I used to be so out of breath when I'd do anything strenuous - not any more.  I'm comfortable in my own skin again.  My BP is down!  I'm completely satisfied with small portions and have zero cravings. 

If this doesn't work for you - or if you have bad side effects - perhaps Wegovy isn't the right treatment for you.  

Perhaps the side effects are due to another medication you take?
After losing 20 lbs, I was lightheaded and dizzy.  It wasn't the Wegovy - it was because I no longer needed BP medication.      I stopped the BP med and immediately the dizziness was gone.

Have had nausea, the worst, constipation, manageable, and lack of interest in food, have to remember to eat at least 3 times a day, small, small servings.

My taste buds changed and I donât like bland food any more, whereas before I wouldnât touch anything spicy.  I do have fatigue and this can also be from the extreme heat we are experiencing.  My dr is pleased, my blood tests(kidney) are fine.  My blood pressure is lower.  My regular blood pressure is 110/70, and now itâs 90/55-60.  That was scary, turned out to be normal.  Fluids are doubly important now to keep my blood pressure up.  At the end of the day, the results for me outweigh the side effects.

After I complete 10 weeks of .60, I will bump up to the final .68.  My income will go up in 2.5 months. I paid $299 + $94 'membership fee' for 1 mg vial in month 1; then $299 for a TWO mg vial + $94 fee. Now I am paying $299 + $94 fee for a WHOPPING 3 mg vial.

Even before I started compounded Wegovy, I had constant constipation. Stool softeners would only work a little bit. I switched to EXTRA strength Ex-Lax. It works, but I am addicted to it, ha ha!

I just barely qualify for the medicine. I am exactly 5' 5 1/2""  Provider rounded it down to 5'5"", and at 189 => 31% body fat. I actually used a previous provider who got me down from 201 to 189. He didn't weigh my or anything. His medicine ramp up scale was even more slow.

I was able to lose my  semi-temporary weight gain a lot more easily. I got covid 8 months ago, and ate a lot and rested on the sofa. So, the first 12 pound drop went fairly easy and fairly quickly.

Now, I've broken thru a stubborn plateau, and hope my weight loss continues.  Today 182.5; goal 155. If I have to, I can increase from .68 to 1.0 but it is expensive.  1.0 would only last me 3 weeks + a stupid $94 membership fee every mont",4,2024-07-12,

It left me with horrible gastric issues and to top everything off not one but ""TWO""!! of my pens malfunctioned. When contacting Novo Nordisc they were not willing to help what so ever, by how much money they are making I think it would be okay to give me two free pens since yours malfunctioned?!! I can not wait until Zepbound and Mounjaro are approved for weight loss, these are both Tirzepitide and I found that they were a lot more affective I lost more weight and they are actually available. I do not recommend Wegovy at all, and you honestly probably won't even get it for another 10 years at this point since no pharmacy ever has it in stock!",2,2024-01-02,
webmd_587,webmd,Wegovy,"I have been receiving semiglutide injections weekly from a provider that works with a local compounding pharmacy. These injections definitely have pros and cons. I have to take anti-nausea medication at least once a day to be able to tolerate any of the doses, and take it more frequently the couple days following my injection. I would not be able to get the injections without that. I never feel great or normal, but it is usually tolerable. I have definitely had a decreased appetite (which is the obvious goal) but can also be difficult, since most of the time nothing is appealing to eat and you can start to feel more sick from not eating enough. I have personally had a difficult time drinking water as it has become more unappealing as well. So I have to really push it. My acid reflux is a little worse and my stomach often feels tender. I go back and forth between constipation and diarrhea. I had a couple days of frequent sulfur burps. 
I haven't lost a lot of weight as far as the scale is concerned but have definitely gone down inches and my clothes fit more loosely. I am learning that a lot of other people have been having that same experience. That part of it can be confusing and discouraging at times, but you have to remind yourself you are actually losing weight. I think that side effect is actually somewhat common, but I don't think there are really any answers yet as to why, and that it isn't really a well known aspect outside of those of us experiencing that. Part of it may be due to constipation/fewer bowel movements, slower digestion and bloating.
While it has come with a lot of challenges for sure, I still feel it is tolerable enough for me to continue for now.",3,2024-01-01,

I do stick to the diet they recommended for the most part and I exercise 4-6 times a week doing cardio for at least 30 minutes. The only side effect that I have predominately experience is nausea. But because of this Iâve quit smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol which is a huge plus. I canât even think about either without wanting to gag lol. I did have a really painful and intense menstrual cycle last month which can be a result of rapid weight loss. But Iâm willing to deal with it!

webmd_592,webmd,Wegovy,"I am 53 years young and post-menopausal due to surgery (7 years ago) with high blood pressure and cholesterol. My weight has exponentially increased over time. I started Wegovy in March 2023 at 200lbs. Followed the recommended titration, slowly.  I started .25 and then stayed on .5 for two months. I lost 16 pounds in 3 months and was feeling amazing!! Yes, some acid reflux and then slight nausea on dose day but not worse than after a night out of drinking and eating greasy foods!  

Then, the ""supply issue happened"".  It was extremely difficult to locate the 1mg dose and my PCP refused to prescribe the 1.7mg. Most pharmacies I contacted didnt even want to discuss supply and I became frustrated. I tried intermittently to locate 1mg to no avail. I then gained back 8 pounds (but not the 16!). 

I FINALLY found the 1mg dose 2 weeks ago. My pcp recommended I return to .25mg due to possible GI issues but I went for it and took the 1mg as I had minimal to no side effects from the other two doses. Unfortunately, I ate a pretty big meal that evening and then took the 1mg injection. I was sooooo sick all night long, pressure on my stomach and nausea all night. And you cant 'undo' the injection once it's administered. I decided to stop fighting the nausea and vomited the next morning, which made me feel so much better. I was very nauseas for a few days and am happy to say that I am back on track with weight loss with no side effects after my injections (3 so far). Ive lost 6lbs in the past three weeks. 

Due to the lack of appetite, I am making sure my body is getting enough vitamins and minerals by taking supplements and forcing myself to eat things like oatmeal, vegetables etc.  I have a company in my town that will do my labs for a reasonable price which for me is important for holistic wellness (insurance is finicky).

I combined this with 3 days/week of exercise and calorie control (the medicine does the portion control for you!). The first few weeks I had side effects, but now I only notice not being hungry the day I take the shot. If  I eat something fried (chicken wings, mozz sticks) or greasy, my body reminds me that I shouldn't be eating it and i feel sick (or wake up mltiple times in the night for the restroom)...but honestly, that is not a bad reminder to stay away from those fat/calorie dense foods.

Iâve just started the .5 dosage today and am now adding gym 5 times a week and committing to a stricter diet so Iâm hoping by end of month two Iâm down 30 pounds total. With the pace Iâve been going itâs definitely possible!

I was at my highest weight 207 lbs and my daughter had just got engaged.  I needed to do something for myself, so when my doctor recommended Ozempic, I decided to try it.  I lost small amounts of weight each week, so was feeling good, but decided I needed some structure, so that I didn't go back to my old habits.  I joined Noom and that kept me paying attention to what I was eating and where my weight was at.  I felt nauseous and immediately full after a few bites of food, but never got sick.  I couldn't eat greasy food and if I did, I would feel very sick after eating it.  After a few months of Ozempic, I switched to Wegovy because of the shortage but still continued to feel good.  I'm so happy to say that I've lost 60 lbs and am just short of my goal of 140lbs by 5 lbs.  This medication is a miracle for those who have tried unsuccessfully to lose weight on their own.

Also, any time you start a new dose, it may also come with a bit of nauseousness. I've had no desire to drink alcohol which I love. I used to drink quite a bit.

It would only last about 4 days then my appetite would pick back up. 1.7 is my sweet spot. I eat about half of what I use to eat pre-Wegovy.

I began on the max 2.4mg dosage after trying to obtain lower doses for nearly a year to no avail.  I dropped from 260 lbs to 237 lbs in 2 weeks.  The first 3 days at this dosage was absolute hell, which I expected.  I vomited 4 or 5 different times over the first few days and felt drained and fatigued.  I could not stomach any food whatsoever during the first 3 days and just sipped on a bit of water from time to time. However, after the 3rd day, I was 100% and back to normal in all ways, except my appetite.  I hardly ever feel hungry and when I eat, I can typically only eat a small portion before feeling full.  For example, 2 weeks in, I can only eat like a 3rd of a cheeseburger or a  half of a salad.  Another good by product is that I hardly drink anything alcoholic any more (beer and wine).  Just no craving for it.  When I started week 2 and took my second injection, I was expecting to have to go through hell again.  That did not happen.  Felt great and still do starting my 3rd week.  Lots of energy, no sleep issues, and losing lots of weight.  Just took my 3rd injection yesterday and feel great.  In summary, the first 3 days absolutely sucked for me, but so glad I stuck it out.

webmd_621,webmd,Wegovy,"If you use any medication you will have side effects that you don't want. Thats what drugs do. They give side effects to combat an ailment. Even multivitamins can cause vomiting, dehydration, gi issues and lightheadedness. If you don't use as prescribed then it is not the med to blame. If you expect to take a shot and wake up tomorrow 100lbs less you will be disappointed. 

I have had side effects but got through it. It wasn't pleasant but I got through it. I am happy to stay close to a bathroom once a week if it means my body can be in less pain because of my weight. Getting older sucks way more when excess weight mixes with normal wear and tear. 
I do think that too many people are not realistic about what this does. It doesn't fix everything by itself and nothing is going to give you that social media glow that isn't real to begin with. Even when you do lose a lot in the end, you now have another round of new problems. You look like a deflated balloon and are dealing with the complexity of being a fat person in a stranger's skinny body. 

Moral of this story. If this works the way you think it should you didn't need it to begin with. If you quit because you don't like the side effects, you didn't need this to begin with. Some of us are desperate, including myself, and will do anything to feel less pain. No one should stay on a med they don't like but don't blame it all on the drug.",5,2023-08-04,
webmd_622,webmd,Wegovy,"I have been taking Wegovy since the end of April 2023. Due to supply issues, I took 2-months worth of the .25 dose and then now 2-months worth of the .5 dose. I have one more dose of the .5ml pen left, but have put off taking it due to experiencing extreme side effects last week (the 2nd time this has happened). It feels like a really bad case of the flu, mixed with nausea, vertigo, a horrible headache, fatigue, and having a very hot, flushed face that I cannot cool down no matter what I do. I canât stand for more than a few seconds at a time either. Itâs seriously awful. I have been prescribed nausea medication and will still sometimes throw up out of nowhere. Mostly like acid reflux. I noticed that this has happened a day or two after taking my 6th or 7th shot of the SAME dose. It is almost unbearable. Also, it is really scary that these side effects can appear seemingly out of nowhere when other weeks I feel mostly fine (maybe not ever 100% but manageable). I think these side effects may also be corresponding with my period, but thatâs just a theory. So, adding that into the mix is the cherry on top of what is a horrible experience. 

Some weeks I feel less hungry than others, but it has never been consistent or gotten progressively âbetterâ with each week. I already try to drink a ton of water, but have upped my water intake even more since starting the medication in hopes of helping avoid any potential side effects. I have also tried to incorporate more protein and veggies into my diet and stay away from really greasy foods or lots of sugar. Again, some days or weeks are better than others, but overall, I have made some decent improvements to my diet and still havenât been able to lose much weight or keep off the little bit I have lost. When Iâm not experiencing extreme fatigue or any other side effects, I am usually able to exercise 2-3 times a week. But if the fatigue creeps up on me? Forget about it. It will feel like Iâve been drugged.

Overall, Iâm disappointed that the medication hasnât worked the way Iâve heard it has for others. My doctor reminded me that not everyone experiences rapid weight loss in the first few months, but I guess I just assumed (or hoped) thatâs what would happen. She feels that my progress is good enough/gradual and that if I can get my hands on the medication during these crazy shortages then I should try to push through. However, risking feeling like death 2-3 days every 6 weeks has me questioning if itâs worth it. I want to be the healthiest version of myself, but have never found it easy to lose weight without crash dieting. As I get older and my metabolism slows, it only becomes increasingly more difficult. I want to be heart healthy, have energy, and feel my best. So far, Wegovy has occasionally made me feel less hungry, but the anxiety and stress that comes with experiencing side effects and dealing with supply chain issues/coverage is a lot.",3,2023-08-03,

It slows the digestive system, so I took on an empty stomach though instructions says it doesn't matter. Minor side effects. Headaches and the runs the first 2 days and the runs when I upped to the 1.7 dosage for about 10 days. Only other side effect was fatigue. Though when I'm fatigued that's when the weight comes off. Doctor kept me on the .25 doseage for the first 3 months, .50 for the next 2 months, 1.0 for a month and just started the 1.7 doseage 2 weeks ago. 
   Was able to eat the foods I like, though I avoided pasta, bread and sugar foods, diet mainly meat and baked potato. Wegovy curbed my carb addiction considerably, snacking reduced by about 80 percent and meals by about 40 percent. 
   Had a few periods when the weight loss stalled for 7 to 10 days. I lost weight before but never this easy. The cravings for food went away within an hour of 1st injection.",5,2023-07-18,

Got a Lil nauseous and dizzy but bearable. I lost 12 lbs.so happy.My second month had to wait 3 weeks, wasn't available, on backorder! Gained 3lbs waiting. Waiting 4 weeks now for my 3rd month.

But then I was hungry again in about 30 minutes. I just suffered through it and lost 12 lbs. This 2nd round is better. Hunger has finally subsided and I've lost 3lbs per week - 18 lbs total. I have found that Pepcid has helped with nausea and occasionally I've laid down because of dizziness, but all-in-all I've been happy with results.

Due to lack of supply, I lasted 2 weeks without any medication. I jumped up to 1.7 because .50 and .10 were out of stock until further notice in my area. I am on my last week of last applicator and I feel horrible. I am nauseas everyday, like pregnant morning sickness. I have extreme skin sensitivity, specially on my back and I feel like my bones are freezing all day no matter how many sweaters/blankets I put on. I can't be with to AC, I still like I'm freezing. Also, I noticed that my tonsils hurt and feel inflamed almost like when getting strep but it hasn't worsen just remains bothersome and feel somewhat swollen. My appetite has definitely decreased and I force myself to eat so I can have a little energy. I'm exhausted and cold all day long with extreme skin sensitivity. I have lost @6 lbs but I think I have lost more Fat % vs actual scale weight. My clothes is fitting loose. I just wish these side effects weren't as horrific.

Once starting the 1.7 mg I have noticed increased nausea and abdominal pain.  As well, recently had two separate times of vomiting and diarrhea, the last being the worst thinking I may have to visit the ER.  I was able to recover but since have had abdominal pain.  I'm concerned after reading the effects for others that I should stop taking the drug.  However, I've had such good results I would rather push through and hope they go away.

Other days you may have a bout of diarrhea, and then it get better. You without a doubt get fuller quicker. Hands down the best thing I have been given. Iâm at menopausal age and as hard as I tried the weight wouldnât budge until starting this. I feel great! All my numbers have dropped greatly, cholesterol, A1C. I do try to walk three times a week for exercise but nothing too crazy.",5,2023-06-14,

Iâm now 3 days since my last shot and I am still overwhelmingly dizzy and feel so out of control. Only thing that helps is laying in a dark room trying not to move my head at all. One slight move and the whole room is spinning all over again. Nausea and vomiting has subsided at this point now.  
Before this medication I was on Mounjaro and that one had gone MUCH better but insurance no longer covers it for people using it for weight loss.

webmd_633,webmd,Wegovy,"In hindsight, all was pretty tolerable until the second week of 1.0mg. After 14 days of feeling increasingly worse (extreme and sudden depression and crippling anxiety, weakness to the point I can barely walk across the house, fatigue, massive brain fog, confusion,  dizzy, cold and chills with no fever, rash on arms, swelling in neck, headache, eye pain, blurry vision,  jacked up blood pressure) I went to the ER. All sorts of abnormal labs for kidney function, electrolytes, metaboloc acidosis and messed up red blood counts. Prior to that dose, I was doing great, exercising daily, sticking to my lifestyle changes and happy with the results. Now I'm weak and unable to exercise, work, concentrate, feeling unmotivated, tired, moody, and anxious. It feels like I'm literally dying and there's nothing that helps. It's everything I can do to force myself to eat and drink a little bit.  This med doesn't help that much to justify feeling like absolute hell, mentally and physically for weeks after stopping it. I see that many people experience the same gigantic kick in the face at the 1.0 to 1.7 mg dose . I wish there was an antidote, I would pay anything to end this torture. I'll do this my dang self once I can muster the strength to move, think clearly, and get out of this quick, hard hitting depression.  Sorry brain, sorry kidneys, bye-bye sanity.",4,2023-06-03,
webmd_634,webmd,Wegovy,"I have been on Wegovy for just over 2 months. I have lost 15 pounds, so I will say it is very effective. I am currently at the 1mg weekly dose, and it is rough. Since the start of this medication, I have had a general ""queasy"" feeling almost all the time. My appetite is definitely decreased. I have also had some dizziness and fatigue and it has interfered some with my workouts. I was eating low carb and exercising regularly before starting Wegovy, but was at a weight plateau. I started this because of my A1C (prediabetic) and triglyceride levels, and I believe weight loss will help both these numbers. I know to avoid weight regain, I will probably have to be on this indefinitely. At this point, however, I don't think I will go above the current 1mg dose, at least for a few months, because the side effects on this dose are pretty bad. Queasy all the time with intermittent nausea, constipation, fatigue, some dizziness during my workouts. I am hoping with time these will get better as the weight loss continues. I don't want to take Zofran, miralax, and colace forever.",4,2023-06-01,
webmd_635,webmd,Wegovy,"I have been on Wegovy for a year and a half, minus 4 months when my insurance was denying the claim due to a misunderstanding. Iâm giving a review because mostly people with bad reactions leave reviews here and my experience has been overwhelmingly positive. It was working so well for me that I did each dose for a few months before increasing to the next level. Iâm just now starting the 2.4mg dose and although Iâm nervous, itâs worth it because the results are so good. 

I had a bmi of 31 when I started and now itâs is 24. Iâve lost about 28% of my body weight and now look and feel great. All my arthritis is gone! I did have some pretty significant nausea and constipation for a few months, but I only vomited once. Some headaches too and just not feeling great. But the longer youâre on it, it seems to get better and I mostly donât have any side effects anymore. We will see with this new highest dose. 

When I had to stop for 4 months, I gained back about 14 lbs, so thatâs why I started it up again. I intend to stay on it so that I can keep the weight off. Totally worth it, for me, and just hoping I donât get any serious side effects from long term use. I recommend people try it if they qualify.

webmd_639,webmd,Wegovy,"I am not obese but have not been at a good weight for 9 years. Have tried all the diets, lost weight but have not been able to keep it off. A friend suggested Wegovy, since she lost weight on it. I asked my doctor and she prescribed it. 

In the first month I lost 10 lbs. When my prescription went to .5, I started losing weight a lot more slowly and having my first side effect, increased resting heart rate. I don't have any other side effects. With the increase in dosage however, I never feel full. 

To date, I'm on Wegovy for 7 weeks and have lost 13 lbs. I don't feel any different and am a bit disheartened that the weight loss is not as quick. I work out with a personal trainer twice weekly and go for daily walks. So far, I'm not really impressed.",3,2023-05-27,
webmd_640,webmd,Wegovy,"I have been on Wegovy since the end of March 2023. In 10 weeks I've lost 22lbs, which is over 2lbs a week. This is a TOOL to help you lose weight. I workout 5 days a week, including strength training. I eat around 1200 calories, but that isn't hard, since the medication does curb cravings. I'm one of those people who has always eaten well and exercised, but after years of dieting and excessive restriction (even Anorexia), my body didn't want to work effectively anymore. For the first time maybe ever, I'm able to eat things I wouldn't normally eat, and not gain weight- but in fact, lose. I don't restrict things, but as an overall healthy eater and Vegetarian, this works wonderfully for my lifestyle. People really need to do their research, though. You are meant to slowly titrate up the doses so that you can eliminate or reduce the side effects. There are ways to deal with the side effects when you have them- drink more water, eat plenty of protein, etc. The therapeutic dose doesn't even start til 1.0mg-1.7mg and many do not lose anything until then, so you have to be patient. I'm one of the lucky ones whose had great success from the beginning, but I do lead a healthy lifestyle. I feel like my body is finally working the way it's meant to. Exercise, choose foods to fuel your body, eat lots of protein so you don't lose muscle mass, and be patient. Don't compare your journey to anyone else's.",5,2023-05-24,

But- my GI tract is still not right. It took at least one week to deal with the aftermath of the hospital visit, and now, 3.5 weeks out from my last dose, I still get queasy/nauseous 1-2 times weekly, so much so that I have to take Zofran, which barely touches it. And BTW- the nauseousness lasts for at least 12 hours, it's not a quick, passing thing. This ""medication"" is dangerous even when used correctly.

I was very dehydrated and in so much pain. Luckily my CT was normal, but my WBC was elevated. Maybe this is some other side effect that will start being reported more often now that half the population seems to be taking it. I started at the 0.25 and did that weekly for 4 weeks. During that time, I was ok but constantly felt somewhat bloated and would burp way more than what would be considered normal. Then came 0.5, one dose. 6 days later I was in the ER. It's now 1 week later, and my GI tract is still not normal. I am glad some people had success with this but for me, my life was way better before this medication.

I do still experience hunger but I am definitely able to eat way less and still feel satisfied. my insurance covers it and itâs working so Iâm happy to continue on the same dosage for another course (4 weeks).

I had to stay on the initial dose the second month due to stomach pain and diarrhea. I am taking Metamucil and drink a 3 liters of water a day. I do feel full fast and there are minor taste issues with food. The general feeling of being unwell does not allow me to eat much. I also am not exercising much but I try to just push through that and I walk.  I have only lost 6 lbs in 6 weeks but maybe slower weight loss is better. I will post again when they up my dose.

webmd_670,webmd,Wegovy,"Iâm on week 5 doing the slow increase up to the 2.4 mg. First month was .25 mg and this month is .50, next month 1 mg, etc. Definitely learned after my first dose to do several things. Be super aware of what I eat on my dosing days and the next two days. Nothing fatty, unhealthy etc. that results in diarrhea. I always take Pepcid in the mornings now and on my dosing day and the next couple of days take another anti acid before I eat. I drink lots of water. Also one time I pushed the pen into my skin and it didnât click to dispense the medication so I lifted up the pen and ended up wasting a lot of the medication ??. Lastly I always take out the pen out of the fridge on dosing days in the mornings then dose at night but not right before bed time. It sounds like a lot but Iâm super happy and excited to be on this med. definitely notice the appetite decrease and Iâm excited to see how things go once I get up to the 2.5 mg dose.

Started up again .25 dose Feb 2023 and feel nothing. Did not take away appetite at all. Increased dosage to .50 and have been on that for a little over two weeks and still no noticeable change in appetite. Wondering if the rush to get the medication back on the shelves changed the med, as in 2022 the .25 worked amazingly.

This would happen before Wegovy but I was sicker. This has helped me not over eat late at night. I did Have Diarrhea one night and a little constipated nothing bad. My appetite is def less than before but you still have to work at it. I have loss 32 lbs in & weeks with a week at an all-inclusive resort where I did drink and ate what I wanted.

webmd_673,webmd,Wegovy,I started a week ago today with my first shot. I made very smart choices with my food and drank a lot of water. The third day I had a severe headache. Otherwise a little nauseous. I am down 8Lbs. So far so good!,5,2023-03-26,
webmd_674,webmd,Wegovy,"Started with the .25 dose, now one the 1 dose.  Working with my Nurse Practitioner to monitor side effects and tolerance to medication.  So far so good.  My Nurse Practitioner also has me adhering to proper nutrition and exercise in addition to taking the medication. 
Working with dietitian to change eating habits and that has been a good experience.  I like the approach because the first 3 months we focused on adding a new goal in terms of nutrition focus so as not to have to worry about everything at once.  My water, protein, carbs and fat each day are now where they should be for me.  Its not so overwhelming now trying to meet my daily goals.  The medication is just helping me not focus on food or being hungry while doing this.  
I have experienced some nausea after the injection but seems to go away after a day or so. We will see how this goes as the dosage increases.  Some foods i dont seem to tolerate as well but they are foods I should not have regulary as a part of my new behaviors anyway so I am ok with that.  Also now understand that those items are choices as well but should not be a regular choice so again the medication is helping with behavior changes. 
On the .25 and .5 dose i did lose weight but nothing remarkable, but this is probably more related to me working on smaller manageable Nutritional goals. 
I am have more significant loss each week with the 1g dose so I imagine this will continue as the dose increases.
After reading some of the reviews I would say your best experience with the medication is partnering with a provider who knows about the treatment of obesity so that you can get all the tools needed to have a good experience.  The medication alone is not enough.",4,2023-03-26,

Decided the risks with this drug donât make it the cure all for weight loss !!",3,2023-03-24,
webmd_677,webmd,Wegovy,"Effectiveness: I've been on Wegovy since 1/19/23, in the first month I was down 15 pounds, second month another 15. I just took my 6th injection today 3/23/23, and am currently at 35 pounds. My BP has already dropped from 130s/90s, to 90s/70s, and have been removed from my first BP Med. 

Ease of Use: Once you get the needle out of your head, it is an easy injection. Both injections on 1.0 have been 'light', as it doesnt feel like the needle is going as deep as the last 8 doses. Todays dose was leaky, even with the needle in and pressing hard. I'll try again next week to see, it'll still do it's job even if some leaked out.

Satisfaction: Overall I'm satisfied, I haven't had much of a change in taste, but have noticed I am definitely more sensitive to smells triggering retching. Nausea for .25 and .5 were very mild, with 1.0 being on the slightly higher side of moderate. The night of the first 1.0, was horrible; But that was my own doing, having eaten heavier foods through the day before the injection, today seems to be back to a more mild sensation, eating like I had been the previous dose days. My partner has been absolutely supportive through this, adjusting his diet to closer to mine. I've mostly stuck to a sausage egg and cheese JD Delight sandwich for breakfast, raw veggies with a yogurt based dressing, or chicken patties with salsa for lunch, and pretty much whatever has been made for dinner. I have greatly reduced overall carb intake, getting closer to a keto diet but not strict. Something you MUST do is tell yourself to eat. My first 2 days after my first injection were very hanger ragey. Lesson learned. Beef seems to be a trigger food for nausea now. One side effect I've experienced more often than anything has been dizziness on standing. The first time I experienced it, it was quick as I was actually getting up from crouching; I actually had to lay down for a minute to come back to myself. Since then, I've either sat back down or just stood and braced myself against something. The removal from the first BP med seems to have really lightened up that side effect though. Outside of that, I am gassy from both ends, but I can't tell if that's the Wegovy or the CPAP at this time; Probably both... but the drug is doing what it's designed to do. I am trying to tell myself to endulge more, as I am somewhat concerned with how fast the weight is coming off... thinking maybe my blood sugar has been getting lower than it should be (have never been diagnosed diabetic), but feel like that could have also been contributing to the dizziness. It has mostly curbed my sweet tooth, I do endulge in a little bit as dessert towards the end of the night, usually a serving of peanut butter cups, trying to include more fruit as well; But overall just learning to be more mindful of what I'm actually putting in, since I'm eating about 1/3 of what I would have before, so that what is going in is actually nutritious. I haven't started getting back into the gym yet, but am planning on it and becoming more active as the weather is getting nicer. I work from home, and have become accustomed to... remaining warm, since I'm now also cold much more easily.

TL:DR, you have to figure out what works for you, what triggers symptoms more severely and how to mitigate them. Having a support system WITH you, not just online, via people who are willing to make these changes alongside you also makes a HUGE difference.",5,2023-03-23,

My only side effects have been tiredness the day after shots, and occassional mild nausea.  The nausea was really just during the first few weeks, I assume as my body was getting used to this. I am 3 months in. 1 month .25 and 2 months .5. This medicine helps me eat less. I'm never starving between meals and when I do eat I simply don't want as much. I have noticed that as the week goes on I get hungrier and I have days where I eat over 2000 calories sometimes when I near my next dose. I am very happy with this med.

webmd_685,webmd,Wegovy,"I have been on Wegovy for 5 weeks. The shots are so painless, I sometimes check to make sure I was the autoject pen actually worked (I inject in my abdoment. I have lost 15 pounds rather effortlessly. The main benefit I have noticed is I am no longer fixated on food. I don't think about eating constantly or have the desire to snack throughout the day nor do I eat voraciously. I started off at 231 pounds (I am a 56 year old male, 5' 10"" tall). That weight put me in the obese category with a BMI of 30. After five weeks, I am at 215 pounds. 

I have reduced my caloric intake by at least 1/2. I am fuller faster and can stop eating with food still on the plate. It has also increased my ability to reject evening snacks. I still think about them occasionally but I am able to resist the urge rather easily. 

As far as side effects, there have been a few minor ones. I started off with a dose of .25 mg and on month two it was increased to .50 mg. The side effects I have experienced were mild to moderate and only happened when I ate too much food i.e. binging. When I ate more than a human being should, I had stomach aches, mild nausea, cramps, and acid reflux. Again, this correlates directly to overeating. The psychological effect of cause and effect (eat too much and suffer moderate physical discomfort) is also beneficial to changing my relationship with food.  I learned rather quickly that binging has a negative consequence. 

I think many of the negative stories about Wegovy can be traced to people either being initially given too large a dose or people thinking this is a miracle drug that will allow you to eat the way that made you obese and still lose weight. It is not a panacea that will allow you to continue to overeat. It is a significant resource to curb cravings and slow down digestion making you feel fuller with less food and also holding you accountable for your bad eating habits should you try to continue them. 

I have found that increasing your water intake and adding fiber supplements to your diet can minimize the side effects of constipation and diarrhea. 

My goal weight is 185. If I can maintain my current weight loss trajectory, I should hit that in three to four months. I had almost given up on losing weight until I was able to get this drug. I am extremely happy with the results and feel the minor side effects I have experienced are completely acceptable and manageable. If used as part of a reduced-calorie diet and with added physical activity, I believe Wegovy can help many people reach healthier weights in relatively short periods of time with minimal side effects.",5,2023-03-14,

I have not had any side effects and found it to be a very effective appetite suppressant. I have, like many others, tried dieting and dieting programs, my last one was Metabolic Weight Loss center. This is a keto-esque program that bids you to increase protein, lower carbs, lots of water, exercise, yada yada yada. But, of course those things don't work very well for me and I feel like a failure, or it does work for a while and then I gain weight again as I live my life. I am a stress/boredom eater, and also eat larger portions that I should. Wegovy was prescribed due to my starting weight of 215 lbs @ 5'7'', and elevated cholesterol levels, which I am on medication for. I did increase my exercise, from nil to trying to go to aquatic exercises, 2-3x/week for 45 mins. So far, I am down to 204 lbs without much effort. I realize that a significant weight loss will be very helpful with my back issues going forward and hopefully will relieve painful flare ups with arthritis, degenerative disc disease, for which i get cortisone injections a few times a year, and allow me to not have to use a CPAP machine.  But, I am a bit concerned that I may begin having side effects with the elevated dosages and may ask if I can stay on lower doses for a longer pd of time, especially since it is working. I read that sometimes people have gallbladder problems if they lose too much weight too soon, so I definitely want to avoid any of that.  Also, to be honest, I am concerned what will happen when I finish with this rx and what tools will I be able to use to keep all or much of the weight off. I will also disclose that I did research all of the common medications for weight loss that are now being used.

webmd_701,webmd,Wegovy,"I am about to start my 6th injection (second dose of 0.5mg), so starting my 6th week on this medication. The first month has been all about adjustment and transitioning to a new way of thinking. Wegovy is a tool to help curb appetite and cravings, which it does for me. In the past, while decreasing food intake for weight loss, I was always so hungry  - and now I am not, and this has been amazing. My cravings for salty snacks and sugar have decreased significantly. I eat a smaller amount of the bad stuff and am satisfied. 

My barriers at this point are psychological - I still want to eat too much at the wrong times, I still want to drink wine, neither of which should you do on this medication. Your GI tract slows, and food and drink stay in your GI tract longer. If you overeat, you will feel awful. If you drink too much alcohol, you will feel awful. In an effort not to feel awful, I have been adjusting portion size and when I eat. I am trying to be aware of these issues - this has been why I have only lost about 3-4 pounds in 5-weeks. Still a victory considering how difficult it is for me to lose weight. (50yo F, 5â10â, starting 232#, current 228#.)

The only side effect I had during the first month was fatigue. It was significant! However, my PCP suggested increasing my protein (wow, was I not getting enough), and I also became more mindful of hydration.

I want to share that the injector pen is gross to use! The pen requires you to press the needle into your skin, then the auto inject starts. I hate feeling the needle puncture my skin! It hurts!!! I use another type of auto injector pen for different medicine which requires that I push the pen against my skin, then I press a button which quickly plunges the needle into my skin and injects the medicine. That is such a better experience.",2,2023-02-10,
webmd_705,webmd,Wegovy,"I am a caregiver and the patient has lost 40lbs on this medication. I am writing to share in the very poor 1 star section an observation about the comments posted here. First, there are quite a few in which the dose does not begin at .25 but much higher, including in one case 1.7mg because the lowest dose was unavailable. The instructions tell the user to work up the levels starting with .25mg so it is understandable you can become quite sick starting with much higer doses. Second, people claim no weight loss at all despite being on the med for months. However they don't share whether they are exercising and eating a low calorie diet. One person said he lost nothing including his appetite so just ate as normal. Maybe his dose had to be higher? Finally, one person claimed to have extreme vomiting, headaches, etc. and that he was eating 500 calories per day.  500 calories is not a low calorie diet that is starvation. Perhaps that is why he had terrible side effects.  In summary, if you are going to complain and be dissatisfied (or even super happy) do explain the basics about your diet, your exercise, on what dosage you have had the problem.  Thanks for sharing.",1,2023-02-09,
webmd_706,webmd,Wegovy,"I took my 6th shot this week.  I have not had much weight loss, three pounds total but my body losses weight very slowly.  I have noticed that you must make a couple of accommodations to this medication.  1.  Drink water.  Seriously, drink a lot of water.  It truly mitigates the side effects if you don't drink water then you will notice a lot of side effects.  2.  Watch spicy foods. The heart burn is very real if you eat spicy foods or if you skip meals.  You have to do some trials to see which foods your body will tolerate.  I have read about others having issues with fried foods, I don't eat fried foods but I can see it could be problematic.  3. Don't overeat.  Listen to that ""full"" signal your body is sending you.  Over eating leads to some bad side effects.  Just realize you are only able to take in so much food at once. 4.  Plan what you eat and prioritize nutrient dense foods.  You can only eat so much so you need to plan your meals.  

Adapting to this medication is not difficult if you listen to your body.  I am still learning how to live on this medication but I am confident in the long run it will work.  I also meet with my Doctor once a month to ensure that everything is ok.",5,2023-02-05,

Started on the .25mg injection and woke up the next day thinking I had covid or influenza because I had HORRIBLE body aches and fatigue. Went to the Dr and was negative for both so then it dawned on me it might be the Wegovy. Could barely  function for the next 3 days I felt so bad and was extremely fatigued. Decided maybe that was just a bad reaction to the first injection so went ahead with the 2nd. 24 hrs later the fatigue is worse, keep falling asleep while working from home and in the evenings. Nauseous and nothing tastes good except for bland food. On overwhelming feeling of severe depression kicked in after the 2nd injection and I've decided I'm done!!",2,2023-01-27,
webmd_708,webmd,Wegovy,"I started with this medication when it was recommended by my Dr due to being overweight, unhealthy, feeling poorly about myself and nothing else truly continuing to help/work including excessive exercise.  I have noticed as I have gotten older it is in my head with the thought I am hungry plus I am a stress eater so I needed help more so with the âfood intakeâ piece.  I started this journey in September starting at 247 pounds.  I do t want to pretend it has been so wonderful because my body has definitely seen the wrath in good and bad ways.  I started out the first month at .25mg and am now in January 2023 worked up to 2.5mg.  The first month I didnât see much in weight loss but definitely noticed a HUGE difference in my appetite.  After the first month I did see the weight start to fall off.  I want to add I was not exercising at all.  My food intake was less and then came some of the not so pleasant things.  Diarrhea, stomach pain, breaking out in a full body sweat but thankfully no throwing up.  However, all of that I described was just as bad.  This would happen when I would make a poor food choice that maybe had a little grease or spice in it.  I did pay for these decisions and for a while I thought this was going to be the new norm and I along with my husband asked myself more than once is it worth it.  I can still say almost February 2023 it is.  I havenât had one of those spells at 3am for a long time now but I also donât eat like I once did.  I am now down over 40lbs and still have a ways to go with this journey.  I will say and want to stress everyone is different including how your body will react to this.  Just like any weight loss you want to take this slow and start with the lower dose to get your body used to this as well as that is what your Dr should be giving.  I know we are a world who wants to see results right now but with this you will just give it time and donât force higher doses or you could be quitting before you truly begin due to side affects.  Some takeaways for me.  When you are prescribed this make sure to ask for some anti nausea medication as well.  I have zofran and I am positive that is the only reason I didnât have vomiting with my side affects.  If you have sulfer burps which I started experiencing the end of December get on some anti acid medication.  I take omeprezol and it is a life saver.  Also try and remember why you are doing this.  I look at my parents (who I have now introduced to this as well) and want to be on better health and be there for my husband, kids and now grandchild.  You have to consider what is best for you.  Donât feel guilty for wanting to help yourself, just be smart about it.  We all go at different paces and I do believe after the research and my own experience this works.  Good Luck",4,2023-01-26,
webmd_709,webmd,Wegovy,"Been on Wegovy for 3 weeks now.  The first week I actually felt full for the first time in 40 years where I didn't want to keep eating like I usually do.  I literally cried.  Feeling full is such a wonderful feeling.  I do need to train myself to stop eating when I'm full, that it's ok to not eat everything on my plate since I'm a compulsive overeater and that it's taboo to leave food on your plate. Once I eat my first meal of the day and I'll stop when I'm full, I'm then full for the rest of the day and don't even want to eat dinner.  I believe that eating very small meals during the day will be a benefit for me in making sure I don't starve myself. I really don't want to eat because of feeling full and that's scary for me.  I am getting help professionally in re-teaching my mind.  My sleep schedule is off, I'm wide awake at night and I do get sick to my stomach with a headache more so in the evening then during the day.  I've also noticed that my taste buds have changed and I'm not tasting the food that same way before I started Wegovy.  I've also noticed that my sense of smell is off as well.  I am so stoked to losing 100 plus pounds and pray that I'll be able to stop taking Wegovy without going back to my old ways once the weight is off. Long way to go so I'm not dwelling on it.

webmd_710,webmd,Wegovy,"F, 52, BMI 35, 5'2"", starting weight 195 lbs.

I've tried and failed at diets and exercise programs for most of my adult life. I can lose weight with extreme calorie restriction and exercise, but the miserable extremes I have to go to are unsustainable in the long-term. Now menopause is looming, and the weight has been creeping up, even with diet and exercise. 

I started 0.25 mg Wegovy in late Dec, and will be taking my 4th shot tomorrow. I have experienced mild appetite suppression, enough to help me shed almost 3 lbs so far (yeah, it's still hard). I have definitely reduced my food intake, and do find it easier to eat smaller portions and make healthier choices, as my cravings are somewhat reduced. I found that my 3rd shot didn't produce the same appetite suppression as the first two, so I'm hoping that graduating to 0.5 mg will give stronger effects. I travel a lot for work, so it can be difficult to make healthy choices on the road, but Wegovy does seem to help.

I have experienced very mild side effects: slight nausea (mostly just when I wake up an night to pee) and constipation (I suffer with this anyway, and take Metamucil, stool softeners, and magnesium). The last few days I've become exhausted in the afternoons and MUST take a quick nap, but I've also been under a tremendous amount of work/family stress, so that could explain it. 

Overall I'm happy with Wegovy, and feel optimistic for the future. My (new as of 1/1/23) insurance provider (BCBS) denied my pre-auth due to lack of 3 months of diet and lifestyle modification, but my doctor is appealing, as I've been doing that for 30 years! Fingers crossed.",4,2023-01-19,

Was nervous about taking this medication but did my research and discussions with doctors.  After a few days of the injection I developed a severe allergic reaction of hives/ rash.  Iâve still lost about 6 pounds in the past week but unfortunately canât continue.  Iâm one of the very few people who this has happened to, however, it was a possible side effect.

Now that Wegovy is available again and my insurance covers it, Iâm on Wegovy. I started on a low dose compared to where I was on Mounjaro. The 1st week didnât produce much weight loss or appetite control. My Doc doubled my dose and I definitely can feel a difference. My appetite is gone again. 

One word of warning about Mounjaro. In my case the constipation was off the chart. I had to be very careful what I ate and if was much at all (a slice of pizza at a party did 
me in) I had to use stool softeners, a laxative and eventually drink mineral oil to break up the road block. Seriously bad situation. Be careful.",5,2023-01-18,

With that being said, I did make healthy-ish choices: soup, salad, salmon, grilled chicken...It is painless and easy to use. I was nervous to administer my own shot but they made it very easy.

Ask your doc for an anti-nausea medication before you start as you may need it the first several weeks.  Works great!    One that doesnât make you drowsy.  Also have Tums and/or Pepcid. You will quickly learn sitting up straight allows you to quickly release acid buildup. Immediate relief.  Will also need to increase fiber and perhaps consider stool softener.  Stay on top of this and donât hesitate to ask your doc about your symptoms versus being miserable.  As with any weight loss, a steady, but small decline is great.  Donât worry if you plateau on occasion.  But we canât continue eating the same things and not exercising!

I am extremely disappointed.  My food intake has decreased.  I did not have the nausea, vomiting and diarrhea that some have reported.  I was not eating much when I started the medication, and that may be why.   I did have extreme fatigue which I countered by drinking Zipfizz (electrolytes and vitamins - specifically B).  I was ready to quit and they bumped me up this week, so we'll see if I start losing.  I started at 268 and now am at 263.2.  Less than 5 lbs in 4 weeks.  For the cost and the risk, so far it is not worth it.  In 2019 I lost almost 40 lbs doing Keto and Carb Manager.  My weight started creeping back, and I thought I'd try this ""no diet"" wonder drug.  I was hoping that using this medication would allow me to put fruit and whole grains back into my diet and help me limit those carbs.  Unfortunately, it just may be for my body, Keto is the only plan that works.  I just got sick of counting everything.  The center said that you don't really start losing weight until the dosage is increased and that they want to make sure your body tolerates it well.  I paid for 10 weeks, but am thinking that it just isn't going to be effective for me.  I would have been happy with 2 lbs per week, which, I don't think is too much to ask given the cost.  If I have to count carbs and calories, what is the point?  Keto keeps away the insulin spikes so you're not hungry.  This was supposed to be effortless... but if you've already changed your diet and don't eat much, it just might not work.  Maybe it's my age and being post menopausal.

webmd_728,webmd,Wegovy,"Been on it for exactly one week, it was an interesting week.  I may find that I come back and add another review later that is rated higher, 

 Brief background on me, I have been a gym rat since 2008, very healthy, I eat lean chicken, veggies, and complex carbs, no added sugars, no processed foods and only drink water, green tea, and milk... 

 but I was post-menopausal in my late 30s and which caused massive weight gain (60 pounds), though my diet and exercise never changed.  

Got on HRT and lost 20lbs but could not get under 200lbs. My weight fluctuated between 200-230 for 3 years..  I even intermittently fasted. 

 I asked my doctor about Wegovy and I was given a prescription.  My labs are good, no high glucose so insurance wouldn't cover it.  I filled my script at a compound pharmacy.  They mix it with B12 and I get it for $150 per month. 

 I  need to go from 211 pounds to 150.  The pharmacist told me to take 15-20 units. 

 The next day I took 18 units and felt great!  Not hungry, very focused, no side effects- I always drink a gallon of water a day...  

In comes the nightmare of my first night... 

 I normally take 1/2 of CBD gummy at night to help me get a full 8 hours of sleep... so as usual, I ate it and went to bed at 10 pm.  

At 10:30pm I got super hot, dizzy and massive sweats...so much that my hair was soaked.  I ended up passing out in the bathroom, falling face down... I had to be rushed to the hospital as I kept losing consciousness, I had all the severe side effects, minus nausea.

  After about 7 hours I was released.  

Turns out, that the CDB interacted with it, and plus I was only supposed to take 12 units. The combo of CBD AND taking too much (not preloaded injectors) caused severe reactions. 

 I have been fine since.  

No more CBD!  

 My current problem now is am not sleeping at night.   So I am unclear if the CBD gummy caused the reaction or if it did so because I took too many units of Wegovy.. either way, I am waking up at 3 am.. ugh.  I don't know what to do to stay asleep as I am scared of taking ANYTHING to help me sleep as I never want to experience what I did the first night.   

Taking the sleep issue out of the equation.  I lost 8 pounds in my first week and I feel fine. This is the first time in 3 years the scale or my measurements MOVED DOWNWARDS! 

Those who want to take this: Make sure you tell your doctor EVERYTHING!  

You have to change your diet to avoid nausea, gas, and those types of side effects.   Eating carbs, sugary things or over-eating will cause stomach issues.   

Cool it on the caffeine and get plenty of water.  keep track of your food and how you are feeling and stay in contact with your healthcare provider.  

If I can go back to 8 hours of sleep, then I can raise my rating.  I am looking forward to this journey of finally moving out of the category of Obese!  I will be contacting my doctor to see what we can do about my sleep. Other than that, I am satisfied.",4,2022-10-29,

webmd_737,webmd,Wegovy,"I started this medication March of 2022, as I write this it is August of 2022. I started at 247lbs standing at 5â9â I did show as Obese on my BMI. I am now 177lbs which means I have lost 70 lbs in 5 months. This medication is a miracle worker but I have spent about $100 on vitamins, laxatives, and other medications to help with the side effects. If you are serious about weight loss the side effects are just something you have to deal with. I have nausea, constipation, vomiting, low iron, and a multitude of just other little things. I highly recommend buying ginger ale, multi vitamins, vitamin D, and a probiotic to help reduce symptoms. I LOVE WEGOVY!",5,2022-08-28,

I have learned what I can and cannot eat on this medicine.   More of a mediterranean or paleo diet.  Has been wonderful for me.  Lost 40 lbs since March.  Listen to your body tell you it is full.  If you over eat, you will be miserable for a while.  One word of advise... You cannot eat late and go to bed.  You will have indigestion, nausea, etc as mentioned in the other comments.  READ ABOUT THE MEDICINE, then decide it it is for you.",5,2022-08-26,
webmd_739,webmd,Wegovy,"My doctor started me at the 1.7mg level at the first of July.  I've lost 11 pounds even though I skipped a week( the fifth week) when I went on a summer trip that involved a long flight. (I didn't want to be sick over the Pacific and stuck on a plane.) My insurance surprisingly covered it, probably bc I have tried all sorts of things over years to lose weight.  I started off needing to lose 20 pounds but hopefully 30.  I was quite sick with vomiting the very first dose of the first week, for one day.  Hwr, since then I take a Zofran an hour before the injection and do this right before bed.  I have experienced all the negative side effects at some point or another, but feel they are all manageable. I'm a bit frightened to go up to the 2.4mg dose, but I'm just planning ahead for a couple of rough days.The worst for me is the fatigue. I used to work out more, but now I'm without energy. I'm just making the choice to do it anyway, and I do feel better when I do. I do not plan to take this medication for the rest of my life, but I'm not sure how getting off of it looks. I am very curious about the science of this medicine and how to stay at a healthy BMI without it.  I was prescribed Plentity before this, and I stockpiled it with the plan to take it after I finish Wegovy. My doctor isn't sure this will work.",4,2022-08-24,
webmd_740,webmd,Wegovy,"I was surprised to read how many people experienced bad side effects. I did not, fortunately. Some loss of appetite, but I figured that was kinda the point, at least at first. I had a little nasua the 
first week on .5, but it went awayin a couple of weeks and never came back.  When I do eat, I enjoy my food. I am just able to eat less, and less frequently, without being uncomfortable or stressed. I have been on it for about 10 months now, topping off at 2 mg. I have lost over 30 pounds, which since I am short was almost 25% of my body weight and has made a tremendous difference. It would be best if I lose about 7 to 10 pounds more to be at my healthiest weight but have been a little stuck for the last couple of months. My doctor is increasing dose to 2.25 which is still a little lower than the prescribed dose of 2.4 used  in the study. I am optimistic that will do the trick. I LOVE this medication.

The heartburn is like nothing I've ever experienced and now I'm on the 2.4 dose and have decided I am DONE. I will not punish myself anymore with this drug. On this dose I feel nauseous, dizzy, and exhausted as well as the horrid heartburn. I'd rather be fat",2,2022-08-09,

My side effects thus far have been super mild compared to what I've read here; some mild nausea and constipation, but that's really it, and I guess I'm tired a bit, but I can't separate that from the rest of my normal life, stress, whatever. I haven't slept well in eons, so it is more likely related to adulting in general, and not med-related. I get nervous at every jump in strength, but so far, that hasn't been an issue either. I guess we'll find out when I jump to the maintenance dose. My biggest frustration has been with price (my insurance doesn't cover it) and accessibility, and my biggest fear is maintenance when I finally (if I ever) reach my goal weight. This obviously isn't sustainable forever (who can afford that?!) but I will appreciate the jumpstart it's given me, I guess regardless of where I net out down the road. Good luck all!",4,2022-08-02,
webmd_745,webmd,Wegovy,"I have been on Wegovy for 2 months and have dropped 40 pounds. This is good, but it comes at a cost. The drug has totally changed my relationship with food. I always loved food. Every meal was an event I looked forward to, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. But due to childhood trauma (being starved as an infant), I always ate way too much. Sometimes 3 or 4 times what might be considered a normal portion. 

Since taking wegovy, I can't enjoy food at all anymore. Eating even a small amount makes me feel ill. Swallowing itself causes pain. I've never vomited and the feeling passes eventually. But I no longer look forward to meals and sometimes I'll just skip eating altogether because I don't want to go through the hassle and pain.

I feel like the protagonist in Clockwork Orange. I've been conditioned by a drug to hate one of the things I've always loved most. It's the mental strain of this situation that has caused me the most stress. Far more than the nausea and pain of eating itself. 

But I need to accept it, or face weight related conditions like diabetes, heart attack and stroke. Living longer to see my grandchildren grow up outweighs my passion for food. So, I'll keep taking my shot. Unless they invent a pill that allows you to eat as much as you want and never gain weight.",4,2022-07-27,

By far, the worst side effect has been the vomiting, even with Zofran. Like many here, finding the correct dosage was a challenge, even resulting in delayed refills. I found the vomiting was worse after a delayed dose. I hope to be able to live with the nausea, fatigue and extreme vomiting long enough to lose at least another 80 lbs. I have found that the day of taking Wegovy and the next 3 days are the worst, but of course by then the next dose is around the corner.

My body tolerated the .25 but not the .5 I would be nauseated the day after taking it and vomiting, then it would subside.

Most of my side effects are during the first few days of the injection. I have lost 10 lbs within the first month but then nothing so far since. I have considered stopping multiple times due to the side effects. I have random bouts of nausea but worse in the morning when first waking up and i take a few drinks of pickle juice and it goes away usually. Worse than the nausea for me is the intense fatigue. I nap daily and have no energy to exercise for the first few days after my injections. On the lower doses i was getting outside and exercising but it causes so bad fatigue and weakness itâs hard now. All in all for me, i donât think losing 10 lbs has been worth giving up my entire summer being sick form this med and unable to enjoy stuff.

The cramping is definitely uncomfortable but fortunately only happens to me about once a week.  Iâve also noticed if I eat certain foods 
(greasy foods mostly)  it can make the cramping worse. Overall  I eat pretty healthy and have no cravings for sweets or chocolate! I will eat it on occasion but do not get the same satisfaction from eating it as I did pre-wegovy.  Itâs very important to drink a lot of fluids, on days I feel blah I will drink Gatorade or Powerade zero and that has really helped. I have also taken Zofran a handful

webmd_761,webmd,Wegovy,"Iâm a 56 year old female, 5â11â and started out at 227 pounds. I have struggled with my weight since high school. Like many, Iâve had temporary weight loss successes, regaining everything and then some, each time. My realistic goal is to be 195lbs. My ideal goal is 180lbs. I have currently lost 23 lbs and have been on the program for approximately 6 weeks.
 I began the standard titration schedule in April 2022. Luckily, my insurance covers the medication!! Due to a pharmacy glitch, I only had one of the .25 doses before jumping to .5. The result was 3 miserable days of the gut wrenching vomiting described elsewhere in these reviews. I contacted Novo Nordisk to ask questions and report my experience and was told I would be receiving a call, which I never got.
My titration schedule since the week 2 glitch, has been smooth. Iâve chosen to have my Rx filled by a large mail-out pharmacy, reasoning that they will get inventory priority over my small town local pharmacy. So far I have not experienced the medication shortages suffered by others. 
I am currently one week in on the 1.7 dose. I have no intention of stopping the medication, but it is definitely not a walk in the park.
Intermittent nausea, deep fatigue, headaches, constipation, general feelings of yuckiness, plus  my initial bout with vomiting, have made this a difficult journey. Zofran is my friend. My goal is to stay on the medication for at least two months at the 2.4 dose, giving my body plenty of time to adjust.  My credo is that I would rather be sick for a little while than fat for the rest of my life. 
I have had no hair loss (an adverse effect  reported in these reviews but not in the Wegovy literature), nor have I had any other serious or life threatening side effects.
Like most, I have an extremely reduced appetite as well as a distinct change in the type of foods I find appealing. Like another reviewer, I canât tolerate heavy greasy foods. Fresh and frozen fruit are my favorites. I have increased thirst and find myself guzzling ice water (I also happen to live in New Mexico which has literally been on fire for the past 6 weeks, contributing, Iâm sure, to my feelings of being parched).
Overall, Iâm extremely grateful to finally have a chance at real and lasting weight loss. My knees hurt less, my self image has improved, my clothes are more comfortable and less tent-like. Moving around is easier in general. Iâm no longer embarrassed by how much food I consume. Iâm still too ashamed to be seen in a bathing suit, but soon even that will be a possibility (I want to start swimming again). I have hope again.",4,2022-06-11,

webmd_764,webmd,Wegovy,"I have been on the drug since October and have lost 40 pounds. Cycled through 0.25, .05 and 1.0 doses with no major issues. Started 1.7 dose just as I got COVID. Horrible side effects (almost ended up in the ER from dehydration) and could not tolerate the 1.7 dose so my PCP recommended I go back down to 0.5 and cycle through again until my body could handle the higher dose.

Just finished my time on 0.5 dose and now cannot get any 1.0 dose pens from my pharmacy. The drug manufacturer has no supply of 1.0. Apparently there is now a national shortage. They are saying they should have some in ""the second half of 2022"". Not sure what that means - June? December? Glad the manufacturer is being so transparent. My pharmacy told me to start calling around to see if anyone has any Wegovy and they will transfer my prescription. Who has time for that? 

Basically this drug manufacturer has left their customers high and dry. There was ZERO communication that there was a supply problem. I would not have cycled through doses a second time if I had known I was going to have to go off it again. I won't be waiting around for them to decide to actually supply the drug to consumers. I certainly will not be cycling through doses a second time.

For anyone who has not started Wegovy - don't bother. Since they cannot guarantee supply, I would not start down this road. You can't just stop, start and jump doses unless you want potentially severe side effects. 

Clearly this drug manufacturer does not care about the people using this medication since, ""Novo execs are pleased with Wegovyâs launch so far."" Not sure how they are pleased with a launch that leaves patients high and dry and having to discontinue use of the drug after MONTHS of stepping up doses. This drug costs me $1300+ per month so this is not something I take lightly, not to mention the health impacts. I feel I have wasted over $10,000 in drug costs.

Insurance was not going to cover the drug after my 6 month coupon period ended anyway.",3,2022-05-03,
webmd_776,webmd,Wegovy,"After taking my first shot of the 1.0 mg, within 6 hours I was vomiting every hour.  2nd day that was reduced to every two hours. The nausea was horrible and the stomach pain really bad.  Third day my husband dragged me to urgent care where I had severe dehydration.  After 4 hours of tests and 3 bags of fluid and anti-nausea drugs I was released to go home.  It's been a week since all that happened, and my stomach still is not 100%.  I'm going back to losing weight the old fashion way by smaller portions and daily walks.  I have issues with my thyroid and losing weight is very difficult, but I don't want to ever feel that awful again.  I'm glad others have had success, it's just not for me.",2,2022-05-02,
webmd_777,webmd,Wegovy,"I work for Bariatric and Medical weight loss for my local hospital. I have NEVER had weight issues. I started putting on weight in my mid 40's. I'm very active...I play softball a few times a week, crossfit (LOVE), 5k's and did bootcamp while doing crossfit. I'm NOT a big eater & I don't like fast food much. I eat decent but was told not enough. At lunch I always walked over a mile but I continued to ""BLOW UP""...literally! I found out I had Hashimoto disease which explained the bloating. Once I started my medicine for that my weight started to come off. Our drug rep came in one day with Wegovy. I asked my doctor in my office about it & was told I could try it. Me and some of the nurses started taking it. The side effects weren't to bad at first. The 3rd & 4th month was HORRIBLE! I was having IBS attacks...vomiting & #2 at the same time, tired, burping more. If I ate something...which wasn't much...if I sat down to watch tv I started feeling like I was bloating up, like I had to burp. Once I stood up I would burp & I could immediately feel the bloating going down. Then I would have attacks if I drank my protein shakes. Then I had attacks if I drank milk. I tried Almond milk & I had attacks....so I stopped drinking any form of milk. I was told by the drug rep that Wegovy doesn't do well with people that doesn't have a gallbladder...which I don't. I have lost over 20pds but I'm sure my thyroid medicine helped with that as well. I noticed since taking Wegovy I have lost some of my muscle mass which for EVERYONE is not good. You want your fat mass to go down & your muscle mass to go up. As I'm reading some of these reviews, I'm reading that some are losing a lot fast. That isn't good & it is probably muscle mass, not a lot of fat mass. 
Another side effect for me and another coworker was gag reflex. I was brushing my teeth & then tongue and I literally vomited!! NASTY!! I took my last shot this week & I'm done. I'm glad it has helped some people BUT remember to consume 85 plus grams of protein & more if you are exercising more. Drink a lot of water and do weight training!!",3,2022-04-27,
webmd_778,webmd,Wegovy,Started on .25 in November and every month moved up and am now on 2.4. Greatly reduced appetite has enabled me to sustain weight loss program. Post-menopausal and 60 - have lost 36 pounds in the winter with less than normal exercise.  Very effective in supporting weight loss - few people understand that some people experience hunger more than others and this medication significantly reduces appetite.,5,2022-04-23,

I have another 50lbs to go but am now more confident than ever that I can reach that goal. I have been overweight my entire adult life but menopause really put me over the edge. Nothing else I have tried has worked like this. Currently on the 1mg but am moving up this week. Unlike others, I have had very few side effects. A little sick to my stomach and a little dizzy but that is it.  Nothing I can't handle. My energy level has actually increased which is not something I have heard. This has been a true miracle for me!",5,2022-04-22,
webmd_780,webmd,Wegovy,This medication has definitely curbed my appetite. Since I was a kid I have always been a hungry person and never able to go more than a few hours without eating. I typically compensated for years by extreme exercise.  After combining Covid isolation plus menopause I was obese and not feeling good. Wegovy combined with a low carb diet and exercise has made the pounds continue to fall off. I can now eat literally half or less of what I would eat normally with no stress. My brain really just tells me now thatâs enough. Thankful for science and this great advancement for weight loss!,5,2022-04-19,

I recently increased to Wegovy 1mg and had a tough adjustment,( abdominal pain, fatigue, just feeling run down, GERD with feeling like everything I ate just sat in my stomach for 48hrs. ) however, it slowly improves over the first few days, now itâs April and Iâve lost 23 lbs, down to 133 and feeling like itâs been worth it.",5,2022-04-16,

Although Iâve lost weight, Iâm not going to sugar coat the side effects.  For me itâs the  sudden nausea with bloating, constipation and fatigue.  By now, Iâm learning to manage by using OTC nausea medication and stool softener. Sometimes I want to stop using it because of the symptoms, but seeing the lbs come off keeps me going.  The medication really does curb your appetite dramatically.  I donât feel hungry at all.  Every patient will react differently but you wonât know until you try it.  I canât see myself increasing the dosage right now.  I donât think I can handle a higher dose.",4,2022-04-12,

I have a sensitive stomach so I am not surprised I experienced every side effect. I did not have any issues with .25 or .5.

Itâs truly been a miracle for me, my appetite is very small and I get fuller, faster, which is the whole concept of this hormone. My doctor and I have decided to stay at 1.7 since Iâm doing so well, that way we have a backup. This past month I will say I feel like I need to titrate up, as I donât seem to be getting full and Iâm starting to think about food more. I would like to know if anyone else has noticed a decline in effectiveness. Iâm still happy, plan on taking it forever if needed, with my success, itâs clear my body was depleted of this hormone. The majority of my weight came off in the first couple of months, now Iâm steady, losing a pound or two occasionally, Iâd be happy here, although my goal is to be 11lbs lighter. Stick with it, I had nausea up to 1.7, now itâs non-existent. Keep a bag of saltines with you, have a couple when you experience it. Highly recommend this drug.",5,2022-04-09,

But after I went up to the 2.4 I started experiencing sensitive skin on my arms, legs and back.  It felt like sunburn but there was no rash, no redness.  It was very weird!  At times it was severe, especially on my back.  I actually went to my doctor thinking I had shingles.  But it has for the most part gone away.  I am still having just a small amount of sensitivity in the skin on my back.  My sister started Wegovy after me and started having the same sensitivity in her skin.  That's when we realized it must be from the Wegovy.  I have noticed my hair is dry feeling.  But over all once I got past the ""sunburn"" feeling, I am pleased with it.",4,2022-04-07,
webmd_787,webmd,Wegovy,"I started Wegovy 9 months ago and have lost 25 pounds (210 down to 185) and I would like to drop another 20.  I am on the full maintenance dose and the weight loss seems to be leveling off.  I have not tried to lose weigh--it has just happened due to decreased appetite.  Finally something that works!  I have always had a big appetite and after menopause it really became a problem.  It seems incredible to me now that I'm not needing to eat as much.  I avoid junk foods but still have a strong sweet tooth and indulge in sweets fairly regularly.  In have had constipation, some low level nausea, some fatigue, and tingling skin at times, but not to the point of stopping Wegovy.  These side effects are mostly felt on day 2 and 3 following the injection.  By week's end they are typically gone.  Side effects also occurred when moving up to the next dose level.  But after a week at the new level the side effects dimished each time.  I lingered at .5 for two months rather than going to the next level and did the same spending two months on 1.7 because I didn't want to deal with the side effects.  Once I took the plunge and made it to 2.4, I was glad I went for it.  The first few days at 2.4 were rough but I'm okay now.  I'm about to begin my second month on the maintenance dose and am hopeful that the weight loss will continue.  I think it will because I am just not craving all the calories.  My doctor provided me a Rx for nausea, which I have only used a few times.  Also, I have continued on 10 mg of Omeprazole for acid reflux that I had taken for 5 years prior, and I did not need to increase it once I started Wegovy. I also take thyroid medication without incident.   The weight loss has really helped my arthritus knee pain,  and I feel that has been worth the trade-offs .  My doctor is pleased that the weight is coming off slowly because, she says, it is more likely to stay off that way.  I am concerned that if/when I stop taking Wegovy my appetite will return along with the weight.

I do get body aches (like Fibromyalgia) all over until the 5th or 6th day (before I take a new shot). No nausea. I am at 1.0mg. I am debating if I should go up to the 1.7 mg.

I was losing my hair, I was always cold and could not sleep at night. Iâm not sure that losing 25 pounds was worth using Wegovy. I never made it past .50 The nausea stomach cramps and constipation were more than I wanted to deal with. It is April 2022 and I have lost a lot of hair and my hair became very brittle and is breaking off. I do not recommend this for anyone taking thyroid medication.

I try to drink around 100+ ounces of water a day. So far no side effects on either the .25 or .50 doses other than fatigue and being constantly cold. But at 55 years of age and going through menopause, I welcome the cold. I am nervous about the higher doses, but I cannot let it bother me. I put off taking my first Wegovy injection due to fear of side effects - and that was a mistake since I haven't really had any so far. Slow and steady is best.

Some weeks I don't lose any weight but then the next week may lose 2-3 lbs.  I have not had any serious side effects.  Occasional nausea 1st few months but  would only lasted a few hrs. Occasional stomach cramping. I have found that when I experience these side effects it is due to forgetting to eat, eating something I shouldn't (ie: fatty or high sugar foods), or eating to much at one time.  Be sure to drink plenty of water.  I have had mild constipation issues since having my gallbladder removed just over a yr ago, so I have to occasionally take a stool softener but Wegovy hasn't seem to make it any worse. I have cervical stenosis and was having severe low back spasms. I also have some arthritis in hands and feet so I needed to get some weight off my small frame of 5'4"".  So far I'm happy with Wegovy.  I recommend not restricting your calorie intake to extremely and not trying to losing more than 1-2 lbs per week on avg (unless doctor advises otherwise). Remember to eat something every few hrs and drink plenty of water. Don't let yourself get too hungry and then eat too much, that will lead to discomfort.",5,2022-04-04,

I am down 11 lbs in 1 month and I feel hopeful for the first time in a long time!  I am less bloated and down a size.  I have nausea at times but nothing unbearable.  It basically slows your digestion down so I take something each day to help with bowel movements.  I take pepcid each day to prevent any reflux.  My injection also has B12 in it and I think it helps.  I also take a B12 shot on its own about 3 days after my Samgulitide shot.  I should also say I started bio identical hormone therapy around the same time and I think it has helped me a lot at least with the hot flashes!  I feel like my metabolism is kicking it up a notch finally!  If you can work with a reputable medical professional who has experience administering this medication, I recommend it!

I am exhausted so much of the time (many days I need to nap) and have frequent GI upset, although no significant nauseau and no vomitting like others have reported. Frankly, I am really disappointed.  My doctor told me to expect to lose 8 pounds per month and that the side effects are transient and that is definitely not what is happening.

The injections are super easy; soooo much better than a daily pill.  I wish the injector pens could be sanitized and reused instead of thrown away.  I have a hatial hernia and severe GERD.  Wegovy makes this much much worse, especially when Iâm trying to sleep.  With the coupon, I pay about $1200/month as this drug is NOT covered by Anthem.  Iâm a bit disappointed that I have not lost more, especially since I can eat very little without starting to feel some minor nausea. I am prediabetic, and my A1C has gone from 5.8 to 5.6.

I have been a little tired after each injection, but I thought I was just being lazy. Didn't realize that was a side effect. My main side effect is hair loss. I got COVID the 1st week of January and heard horror stories of hair loss after COVID. I have noticed hair in the drain after I wash my hair and when I run my fingers through my hair. I did not realize hair loss could also be a side effect with Wegovy.  Not sure if the hair loss is from Wegovy or COVID. Seeing lots of baby hairs coming in, thank God.Overall, I really am impressed with my weight loss results with Wegovy.  Once I realized the nausea is not constant and goes away after a few days, I knew I could tolerate it. Hubby says I "" eat like a bird"". Feel full after a few bites. Learned quickly not to drink a lot of fluids and then eat. You will vomit. I learned to adjust my fluid intake around my meals. I recommended Wegovy to my sister and she is starting it soon.

It is hard to re-learn how you eat and listen to what your body is telling you, but if you do, you should feel fine. This medicine is a tool not a cure-all.

I am struggling to force myself to eat, and even when I do, I am absolutely done in 2-3 bites.  I have also noticed a serious decrease in energy and overall mood- not sure if this is from not eating or the drug itself.  But the side effects are well worth the results, for me at least.  As far as supply, there are occasional issues with getting it filled.

Then at the 1.7 dose the bigger problems began. 
Super nausea omg I felt so ill I stayed in bed. Couldnt even talk I felt so sick. Also started to give me more muscle spasms ( I have fibromyalgia from Lyme Disease). They were nonstop and horrific. More anxiety,  could not poop at all. When I forced it and took every laxative it was so painful I wanted someone to shoot me dead.
Also..sweating. ugh.
Just awful. So I backed it down to the .5. Made it 4 weeks and after I had more anxiety again and more depression and freaked out ith a major panic attack I'm quitting forever. I don't know if it built up in my body and then caused the problems mixed with my other health conditions or what but this drug is not sustainable. I also vomited terribly on the 1.7 at 3am.
It has the most side effects with any medication I've ever tried. They were delayed, but then I got super slammed. I had to increase my anxiety med because of this.  I hope I feel better in a month. I'm disabled and don't work. I'd never be able to work while taking this drug. I'm glad some can continue.

I personally get extremely nauseous and fatigued for the first 2-3 days post injection.  The medication absolutely decreases my appetite, I get full very quickly and stay full for a long time.  I often feel quite nauseous about 20-30 mins after eating for about an hour and then it goes away.  I  read a lot of reviews that show I much greater amount of weight loss in a shorter amount of time than I have achieved and I have felt frustrated at time by that, however, the clinical trial data shows an 15% weight loss over 68 weeks, which is 17 months.  Therefore, I think my âslowerâ weight loss is ok and I do find the medication effective.  I am also on an SSRI for depression maintenance, which increases my appetite significantly and perhaps slows down some of the weight loss.  Before every injection, I debate if I want to stop the medication or continue it because I feel so sick the first few days, but itâs is working and Iâd like to get more weight off before I stop.  In a nut shell: donât get too frustrated if the weight is not flying off.  Watch your diet, exercise and keep going as long as you can tolerate the med.",4,2022-03-17,

I want to lose 84 pounds, and Iâm down 27 pounds so far.",5,2022-03-02,
webmd_826,webmd,Wegovy,"5 weeks in Iâve lost ~10lbs with another 25lbs to go. I moved up to .5mg after the third dose of .25 and Iâll probably do the same as I titrate up to 1.0 because Iâve not had any nausea-related side effects thus far. Itâs a really great drug for me. Ive tried diet and exercise several times over the years and that program worked but it was SO hard to keep it up for several months at a time and the hunger pains never went away. Thatâs the best thing about this drug - no hunger pains. At all. Zero. The only two things that Iâve noticed is my sleep habits became a little worse. I had trouble sleeping more than a maximum of 6 hrs / night but I started taking melatonin and thatâs helped tremendously and Iâm back to normal sleep. The other is a little constipation. Prior to the drug I was routine once/day, now itâs once every 3-4 days. But I eat so little now that itâs not really an issue. Aside from that Iâve had a very good experience on this drug. Nothing tastes different or worse - I just eat 1/8 to 1/10 of what I used to consume. When I eat too much, which was hard to gauge the first few weeks, I felt like I had the biggest meal of my life, which was uncomfortable, but it went away after an hour or two. You need to learn how much food is enough, which is much less than you think it is. One trick Iâve used is to try to eat very slowly.",5,2022-03-01,

Zero constipation due to exercise and eating a cup of bran-type cereal each day.

I do feel tired a lot, mainly from not eating much, so keeping a food diary helps me up my food intake when itâs too low. 

Iâm currently on 2.4, but I think itâs too high, so Iâm going to ask my Dr. to lower it back to 1.7 next month.",5,2022-02-28,
webmd_828,webmd,Wegovy,"I lost 18 pounds in 4 months using Wegovy.
I started to have intolerable side effects at the 1.7 dose and after 6 weeks had to. Drop it to .5 again.
I have fibromyalgia from Lyme disease and it gave me unbelievable fibro flares. Maybe something to do with the sugars in the muscles. I screamed in pain. Also couldn't eat much at all, was so constipated I would take anything and everything to try and go and only could after 7 hours of lying in the bathroom in the worst pain imaginable.
Woke up at 3 am twice and vomited also.
I also see a difference in the texture of my hair. Very dry. Makes sense if my whole system is dry.
So I'm using the .5 maybe 2x month but I think I'm going off it. I just got my hair back and I don't want to lose it again.
I don't know how many can tolerate the side effects at the higher doses. I was so nauseous I felt like death.
I'll try my best to keep the weight off.
Maybe a low bimonthly dose will help me do that. I am 53 years old. The website wouldn't let me record my real age.
Good luck",3,2022-02-27,

webmd_830,webmd,Wegovy,"I am a 44yo female, have gone from 177 to 150 in just under 4 months. I exercise a lot, but haven't changed what I eat much. The pros... I can feel starving, then be full after eating very little. I'm losing weight pretty consistently. I can still eat things like sushi, ice cream etc, but instead of eating a bunch, a few bites and I feel satisfied. Food I used to love I no longer have any craving for. I have also noticed that even drinking (in a margarita fan) has lost a lot of its allure. I am looking great and about to break the 150 mark for the first time in a decade.

Cons... I feel generally unwell. Like I am coming down with something. It wasn't terrible at first, but as the dose increases, it gets pretty bad. I am on a generic semaglutide so thank God, the prescriber has been able to titrate me insanely slow (often by .25 every week or two) but we had to lower it back again as I seriously was miserable. Since getting to around 1.7, I am having a lot of problems with constipation, way more nausea (like waking at 4am and running to the bathroom to vomit), heartburn, and lots of burping which randomly started this week and really sucks. I exercise about 6 days a week and went from level 8-10 on the elliptical to feeling like I'm going to pass out of I go higher than about level 2. A flight of stairs kicks my butt. I get dizzy super easy. Most of this slowly started around 1mg, but the 1.7 has been brutal. I told the prescriber I don't think I can go higher than this and she seems amenable. So I imagine the weight loss will slow down but it would be nice to find a balance of still maintaining/losing a bit while also feeling well.",3,2022-02-23,

Exercise, drinking nothing but water, coffee, taking  laxatives, prune juice, fiber supplements, probiotics, & enema didn't work & now I'm having 2 see a gastrologist. Its a rough drug but worth it if your obese & need 2 lose the weight fast. My 18 yr old son is on it. He was 240lbs. Hes lost 20lbs in 2 months. His only issue is an upset stomach but he likes it.",4,2022-02-22,
webmd_832,webmd,Wegovy,"I'm on my last 1.7 dose and I've gone from 190 to 163.2 lbs so far. My side effects have been pretty mild. I think I had nausea/stomach pain the first few weeks after I started. Now for the most part I only have nausea in the few days after I've titrated up. I did have one week where I started puking and had really bad nausea. It turned out I'd forgotten to take my dose the week before. I'm writing the date I'm supposed to take each on the shots right when I get a new box now. My appetite has been reduced significantly. Some days I can eat normal amounts of food, but others I just don't get hungry or get full very quickly. I am very aware of when I'm full now, like I'll eat half of my food and then feel like I don't want another bite. If for some reason I do eat past that point I can get nauseous and my stomach might start hurting, but that's rare for me. Also the shots themselves aren't that bad. I do Emgality shots once a month and those hurt a lot more than the Wegovy. My weight loss has been really steady. I don't think I'm done losing weight and the weight loss has been pretty unrelated to my exercise/types of food I eat. I've been stressed and have not been making good decisions in those areas. I'll probably stay on this for the rest of my life if I can. As far as the cost, I get it for $25 with the coupon for now. I was told it would be $100 a month without the coupon. I luckily just got a better job, so I'm just going to pay the $100 a month once the coupon runs out. Hopefully insurances will start covering it more and make it more accessible.",5,2022-02-21,

Let me make a list of what I experienced on this med. 
From Day 2 
I did not Crave food. I did not think about my next meal
I did not feel the hunger one feels when they are obese. You know what I mean
I have gone every morning but two without breakfast. Yes I know its the most important meal. But its also a chance for your body to start burning fat. I dont care what nutritionist say it worked for me in the past. And if I can only have coffee until 1130a I am doing this.

My favorite part of taking Wegovy is that it has changed the way I think about food. For me, the challenge and struggle in losing weight is that I constantly thought about what I was or wasn't eating. Wegovy has changed that. I rarely have cravings. If I do, a small bite of something satisfies the craving. Thankfully, my insurance has approved it through Aug 2022. Hopefully, I will be able to get it for my cost of $25/month after then.

webmd_838,webmd,Wegovy,"I have never been so sick in all my life. Sure it works, anyone would lose weight if theyâre constantly sick. Itâs like a forced eating disorder because if you eat more than a few bites youâll vomit and then eventually you lose your appetite completely. Constantly nausea for 4 months  will do that to you. It did solve a problem for me in getting a large amount of weight off, 40 lbs in 4 months to be exact. Due to a health issue (diagnosis of RA) I suddenly gained a lot of weight and couldnât get it back off. Iâm not sure that this would work for someone whoâs been overweight for an extended period of time for the sheer fact that you donât learn any healthy habits so Iâm not sure how you would maintain it once discontinuing Wegovy. Iâm not even sure i wonât gain it back for the same reason. Not eating is not healthy, vomiting every week is not healthy and is it really safe to mess with your blood sugar and pancreas? Iâm grateful for getting this head start and hope that I can now move to (my own) phase two and work with a nutritionist because I just canât do it anymore. Bottom line it may have some benefits for some people but there are a lot of side effects so proceed with caution. Words just could not express how incredibly sick I have been since starting this!

Wegovy for weight loss was great but there can be hair loss. I called the company to let them know. The lady said she was going to have someone call me about my results and no one ever did. Just know hair loss is a possible side effect.  Wish Iâd hadnât been for me.,5,2021-12-30,
webmd_856,webmd,Wegovy,"I just began month 3 (1 mg). Up until this point I was nauseous, gassy and had diarrhea immediately after I ate, but I didn't mind all that because I could tell it was working. And the fact that I had already lost 20lbs in 2 mos was awesome. I had no cravings, the smell of food made me ill, no appetite -it was great. But now that I've started 1 mg, none of those side effects are happening, I'm back to craving food and I'm back to being able to eat food without getting rid of it right away (diarrhea). So now I'm worried that the 1 mg dose isn't working. It was the .5 mgs where I lost the most weight but was the sickest. Do I need to go back down to .5? Should I just keep going? Not sure what to do but this drug is amazing and I would highly recommend. Not everybody will experience the same side effects, so don't let that keep you from trying it. My nausea wasn't that bad and Wegovy has never caused me to vomit. Oh and I'm a female, 45 y/o and 5'3"".",5,2021-12-30,

Iâve lost 10#, so I must be getting a little of it.  Iâm an RN with 45 years of experience, and this is a less than perfect  injection system.

I have increased my water intake which has helped a bit, but the nausea is unreal. I am on the 1.0 dose and I can't imagine getting to the higher dose. It is definitely a mental adjustment to not being able to eat as much, or as mindlessly. I am hoping Zofran will help with the nausea.",4,2021-12-29,

webmd_865,webmd,Wegovy,I'm on my 4th month of treatment (one more week left) and have made it to the 1.7mg dose. Early on i started noticing constipation but that was an easy fix. Just making sure I eat more fiber and using a stool softener. There would be a few times I felt nauseous but i wasn't eating like i should have. Just trying to learn what my body needed. That went away with some adjustments to snacking and eating. This new dose however has been the hardest for me. The nausea is lingering. There have been a few times that I actually throw up. The nausea usually lasts the first two days of the weekly shot. If I take a nausea pill though it really helps. I notice that I feel full all day long some days. I try to eat something small just knowing that I still need to eat. I don't have any cravings. I've lost around 30 pounds. It started slowly at first but has really increased over the last 4 weeks. I've noticed that many of my clothes are fitting better. With more exercise I think my results will be even better. If you can find ways to manage any negative side affects I think its worth it to stick it out.,5,2021-12-21,
webmd_866,webmd,Wegovy,I started this journey July 9th as a last resort to get healthy enough to come off of blood pressure medicine.  My brother is my best friend and is in need of a kidney transplant. His time if running short.  I am his only full blooded sibling. I went to Tampa to find out how to test to see if I was a match. I was turned away due to being under the age of 50 and on blood pressure meds which make me high risk for kidney problems in the future.  I was told I need to be off blood pressure meds at least 90 days before they will even test me to see if I am in fact a match.  I was devastated. When I returned home I spoke to my cardiologist and he told me to limit salt and lets try to lose some weight and he will monitor my blood pressure and see what we can do to come off the meds.  I went the very next day to a weight loss doctor and discussed options.  We determined that due to the nature of medical needs surrounding my need for regaining my health we would go with the wegovy.  As of December 20th I am down 34lb and about 8 inches off my waist.  I have been monitoring my blood pressure and taking half the medicine strength now from what I was on.  My blood pressure sometimes runs a little low/normal so we are thinking within another month or so I will be able to go without it and see how I do.  If everything goes well I hope to be able to enroll in testing to see if I am a match to donate a kidney for my brother.  If I am a match then we owe it to wegovy for saving two lives not just one.  That is a blessing for sure.  Fingers crossed and prayers raised.,5,2021-12-21,

This is certainly the strangest drug I've ever taken. Iâm hoping for the best. The doctor said she has had no one drop out.

While my cravings have been diminished significantly, I simply cannot eat without extreme nausea even with an anti-nausea medication. Within an hour of the shot, my arm and neck on the side I had the shot felt like they were sunburnt. Within 4 hours, I was vomiting more violently than I did while pregnant. Iâve never been this Iâll feeling since the time I had food poisoning and ended up hospitalized. The nausea is pervasive and will not go away even after vomiting and zofran. Iâve lost 7 pounds in 48 hours. Feel like Iâm drying up. Smells trigger the nausea, even on day 3. Itâs also given me some severe headaches that begin in the evenings and continue for many hours until I managed to fall asleep. I have nasty sulphuric burps and the gas and bloating are pretty bad too. Just started with diarrhea this morning. Not sure what it did to my system, but Iâm not sure that I want to see what a higher dose does to my body.

I continued using this in hopes that I would start to see some kind of change. Unfortunelty no change in my weight what so ever. All it really did for me was give me a weekly two day long headache.

But on the 3rd day, and after, I just be nauseous, and I can't really eat anything, and if I eat to much, I would throw it up.

A few days after that started, I noticed that I had no hair on my legs - none at all.  None on my arms or underarms.  Honestly, I cannot pinpoint the day I noticed this development, but it was definitely noticeable after I hit the highest dosage.  I was freaked out - super concerned I would lose the hair on my head which at the moment, does not look any thinner.  I just got back from a dermatologist this morning and brought all the prescriptions I take.  When I pulled out the Wegovy box, he exclaimed, ""that is so interesting.  I got two calls from PCPs last week that said their patients on Wegovy had small bald spots on their scalp.""  He didn't know what dosage they were on.  He said he is going to contact the manufacturer to report these reported side effects.  He looked at my legs under a special magnifying glass.   He said that the hair follicles were not scarred - the hair was visible but not above the surface.  This would seem to indicate it will grow back.

Did experience bad nausea for a while, so my Dr prescribed Zofran and I take one pill before the injection and I donât have any issues now. Definitely cuts my hunger/cravings way down. I focus on eating clean/lean proteins, fruit/veg, dairy (Greek yogurt) and very few grains. Iâm diligent about checking labels and learned early on not to cheat. This medication will let you know fast if it doesnât like something you ate and you wonât forget.  Been working with a Dietitian and she really helped me with making smart food choices. Exercising one day a week with a trainer and hoping to increase that soon. Weighing myself daily which has really helped.  I can tell how my body responds to any new foods this way. I first tried getting the medication at CVS and Walgreens and they werenât able to get it. My local CVS still canât (asked them recently). I use an independent local pharmacy now and they have no issues getting it. Go figure.

Second week no issues and now into my third week. I am disappointed in the weight loss so far in 18 days only lost 4.4 pounds and that is eating average 600 calories per day, keeping carbs under 80 per day and working out 3-4x per week.

I am barely pre diabetic 5.7 A1c and this medicine hasnât caused me to have low blood sugar that I can tell, even with keeping to under 80g carbs per say.

The first day of injection has been the worse for me accompanied with an annoying headache. I sometimes felt mild acid reflux and nausea that I normally calm with a soda and crackers. I endure dry mouth along with an irritating bitter or nasty taste in my mouth. Other times, I just feel off kilter and can't identify a specific symptom. But I am really concerned about my fatigue which I felt more the second week.  I noticed only a few people mentioned that side affect. My appetite has largely diminished. (Actually, the joy of craving a particular food and satisfying that craving is done). When I do, eat pretty much anything will do. With busy 12 hour work days, I often don't eat at all. I conclude that may be attributing to the lethargy. I have succumbed to drinking pedialyte regularly and intend on drinking more water. I am getting through the day OK but can't wait to lie down when I get home (unusual for me). A few co-workers have commented on my lack of energy and luster, so to speak.  Perhaps Week 3 will be better.  I'm fighting to endure the ""cons"" for the desired result.  I get married in November and would love to be about 30-40 lbs lighter for the wedding.

Pros: Iâm not hungry at all so I have to force myself to eat. When I do eat I eat very little. Cons: I get really nauseated especially on day of injection and day after. The other days are more tolerable. Every now and then I experience some heartburn which subsides with over the counter meds. All in all the drug is working! I can deal with the minor side effects as long as Iâm getting great results. Im eating a lot less and losing weight as a result.

But I still do get very hungry throughout the day. I find that I cannot eat as much as before starting this medication. I have changed my diet and started walking on a daily basis.",4,2021-08-26,
webmd_962,webmd,Wegovy,My PCP prescribed this fiord me and finally after 3 weeks my pharmacy got it in.   I am so reluctant to start this after reading the side effects.

webmd_963,webmd,Wegovy,I started Wegovy 4 weeks ago and lost nothing. Then Pen is irritating because you have to push hard to inject. Wish it worked for me.,2,2021-08-23,
webmd_964,webmd,Wegovy,I am new to this and have only been on it one day. I lost 2.5 over night. Hope it continues. I feel less hungry and have a bit of heartburn but an antiacid helped. I am hopeful for progress toward my goal.,5,2021-08-21,

If I'm pushing into fat in stomach area can push inches deep with no click triggered.  the clicks are loud and obnoxious, the injection hurts   When to pull away from injection site is not clear because the second click is NOT when to pull away.  if giving on upper arm, hard to see yellow bar. the saxenda injections were SO much easier,  I give the Wegovy pen an D-",2,2021-08-18,

webmd_968,webmd,Wegovy,Started out on .25 dose and lost 8 pounds in 3 weeks The last 4 weeks I have lost an additional 6 pounds. I am just not that hungry so my portion sizes are way down. And if I overeat I am punished with feeling too full for hours after. I had some nausea and diarrhea the first week. But now no noticeable side effects. This has been a miracle for me.

webmd_970,webmd,Wegovy,"Sorry to post here, but I am hoping to get advice from those who have started taking Wegovy.  How did you find a qualified doctor to start the process?  Did you just use your standard family doctor or did you locate someone with specific knowledge of Wegovy?  If the latter, how did you find them?  I tried Novo Nordisk, but they were unable to refer to anyone local (St Paul, MN).    Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks.",5,2021-08-16,
webmd_971,webmd,Wegovy,"I am currently on week 2 of the .25 dosage and what Iâve found is that I am simply not as interested in eating as I normally would be, and eat significantly less at each meal. Iâve also found it easier to bypass the candy bowl at work. Iâve made no changes to exercise or to the types of foods I eat, yet I have managed to lose 4 pounds in 1.5 weeks. I did find that if I eat  my dinner too late, I end up throwing it up, but thatâs the only side effect Iâve seen. I donât mind it, because it serves as a behavior modifier. I also seem to have boundless energy, but that may only be coincidental. Iâm extremely pleased with my experience.",4,2021-08-14,
webmd_972,webmd,Wegovy,Just stuck myself today with the week 5 at .5.  Previous four weeks were at .25. Injections have been totally painless.  No nausea.  So unpleasant side effects.  The main effect is that I am just rarely hungry and it does not take much for me to feel full when I do eat.  Only lost a couple of pounds so far.,4,2021-08-13,
webmd_973,webmd,Wegovy,"I have been on Wegovy two weeks now...I started out with the .5 dose since getting the .25 was impossible. My first shot, I did have vomiting about 8 hours later and nausia the first day. However, food intake is way down. The full feeling has really helped me cut out snacking. I am drinking lots of water ( 96 ounces plus a day) and I am sure the first week was a lot of water weight loss, but 8.8 pounds the first week. I have upped my exercise game to ensure I continue the downward trend. No side effects so far with the second shot. I make sure I drink a protein drink.I doubt week 2 will be as good as week one, but reading these reviews it seems I am doing really well in just the first week.   For a person that has struggled and stressed about weight gain my whole life, this simple shot has changed my outlook and I do believe lossing the weight is gonna happen. I am super pumped as I take the 6 month journey ( that $25 card) and see where this goes.",5,2021-08-11,
webmd_974,webmd,Wegovy,"I just started on my second week of the .5mg dose. I haven't experienced any nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain. The first symptom I noticed was a headache while on the .25mg dose. Second was the decreased appetite and the feeling of fullness after consuming very little. I have also experienced belching, but the most significant side effect has been the overwhelming feeling of fatigue for the first few days after dosing.I started on Wegovy on 7/21/21 after a 3 week delay due to insufficient supply. I have lost 8lbs overall so far. I am happy to continue on the course!",5,2021-08-11,

Im on week 5 now with the 2.4 dose and just a little fatigue no other symptoms overall i have lost 10lbs!! So I'm very happy and thts with little to no exercise....I do have to force myself to eat thou..im always full...Im also a type 2 diabetic and I have not had to take any insulin or any diabetic meds since I have started this medication...my average sugar are 99 now...sometimes I go as low as 70 and 80's I use the Libre and it gives u an overall of how your sugars are...so far thus is working for me so yeaaaa!,5,2021-08-07,
webmd_976,webmd,Wegovy,I first started taking this I was sick as a dog. But I started drinking gingerale and it helped tremendously with my nausea. The second week was good still no craving for sweets I lost 7lbs at the end of wk 2. Week 3 I can tell that my craving are beginning to come back and I only lost .4. I will definitely be taking .5 when it's time to switch doses. I'd rather deal with nausea if it means me losing weight in the right way especially with water aerobics and walking with ankle weights.,4,2021-08-07,
webmd_977,webmd,Wegovy,"I'm 69 and have been overweight since menopause--very happy to have this opportunity.  I took my fourth injection yesterday and have lost 9 # so far.  I'm glad I did not read any of these reviews before starting.  I have had some nausea and fatigue, but I am continuing, and  overall  quite pleased.  I will talk to my doctor next week to get assistance with the nausea.  I have been able to continue my exercise regime even though I'm feeling more tired.   I am planning to do a second month at the same .25 mg dose as it does not seem likely I will feel good enough on a higher dose.  My appetite has sharply diminished and really only want to eat twice a day--breakfast and dinner.  I am drinking lots of water due to increased thirst, and I have mostly curtailed my evening glass of wine.  I am hoping to continue to lose pounds on the lowest dose.",4,2021-08-07,

It's more Saturday morning and I'm still nauseated and still vomiting.  I can't keep down the smallest amounts of water.  I think the level of nausea was under played, when it was prescribed my doctor told me to sip some ginger ale to help.  We are way beyond ginger ale.",2,2021-08-07,

No side effects what so ever. The shot is easy in my stomach (thanks to my fat ??). I take one 400 mg magnesium every night when Iâm on a reduced diet so no constipation. My meal portions are so tiny. I try to do little snacks but seriously it is hard to get the calories for nutrition in.,4,2021-08-06,

The main side effect I've had is extreme moodiness, and other lesser side effects are malaise, gassy/bloating and light-headedness. I think the biggest issue I'll have on this medication is eating enough. I have set a timer to eat every two hours a really small snack because I'm just not hungry whatsoever!

webmd_989,webmd,Wegovy,Extremely easy to use - barely felt injection if at all. Iâve been taking this for 2 1/2 weeks. Definitely have some constipation and bloating so that has been slightly uncomfortable. No cravings for sweets which was my biggest issue before starting Wegovy. Struggling to eat enough calories. Iâve been like that for the last several years but prior to Wegovy it was always carbs and sweets.

I didn't even feel the shot at all, I put it in my upper left thigh- where I dont have much feeling anyway. I did get a slight headache later in the day, but nothing else. I woke up this morning w very little uneasiness to my stomach but it quickly went away. I was expecting the worst so this has been a blessing! I did youtube another person who is taking it and she was the same way and then the upped dosage next in line kicked her butt. I hope that isnt the case for me.

The only side effect so far is constipation. The injection is extremely easy to take and not a bit painful (read the instructions or watch the video on how to give yourself the injection).  My appetite has been greatly reduced on just the smallest dose.  I don't have the cravings for sugar that I had before.  I've lost 4.3 lbs in only 10 days.
