1ag1xn2,reddit,r/Ozempic,"First dose yesterday (0.25) Hashimotos/PCOS paying out of pocket. Hi everyone, I am happy to be here and wanted to share that I started my first dose yesterday. The last five years have been very challenging for me in terms of losing weight overall. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s in 2016 and steadily increased weight between 2018-2020. I gained about 60 lbs in those two years and in 2021 was diagnosed with fatty liver disease. I finally was able to get an endocrinologist mid-2023 who diagnosed me with PCOS and prediabetes too and started  levothyroxine. I was able to lose about 10lbs in a month but I was working out a lot and barely eating. My endocrinologist recommended me to get on a weight loss medication last month after seeing how much I was struggling. Unfortunately, my health insurance would only cover weight loss medication if I had been on metformin for at least a year before I was given access to ozempic, mounjaro, wegovy, etc. as they’re listed as Tier II meds. I decided to fork the money and pay out of pocket as I need to get my weight at a better place as I have injured my back and ankle trying to lose weight via exercise in the last couple of months. My SW was 234 pre levothyroxine, CW 228, and my GW is 170. I am hoping I will only have to pay for four to five months of treatment so I can get a head start and try to manage the rest via exercise and nutrition. I am also wondering if others have found other ways to help pay for the medication outside of their insurance and if they may have advice outside of the maker coupons, etc.",2024-02-01,1,1,Both

I started 2023 on WW.  I was very slowly losing, mostly maintaining my weight. Life got hectic, stressful, busy and after around April/May my weight began climbing.

I started seeing a new provider in June.  I explained how active I am but also my binging issues.  We worked through some plans on other issues I was having and when those were under control, we decided it was time to figure out weight control/loss.  I’m an athlete with a serious history of heart disease in my family. I have young children who need me. I cannot afford to have my weight keep climbing. 

On Dec 22 I took my first dose of Ozempic (0.25mg).  I was on this dose for three weeks before switching to 0.5mg.  No real side effects on either dose.   Maybe a little fatigue at the beginning, but manageable. 

🪄 The food noise stopped.  It was like magic. ✨ 

I’m closing in on my 7th week of Ozempic and I am down 15 pounds.  I would never had been able to get to this weight with just diet and exercise alone. My body wasn’t allowing it! 

I still have another 45-50 lbs to go but I now feel hopeful I can actually get there!

I am a WAY better athlete for my horses (this is my life outside of work and family, and its critically important to me to be an effective rider to reach my goals), I feel the best I've felt in years, and I finally had the mental clarity to be able to get help for depression and eventually a diagnosis of (and treatment for) ADHD. I have not weighed below 200lbs since I was 19 -- which was now 14 years behind me.

My horse has changed too, as you can tell, and we have both become more relaxed, more supple athletes in the last almost year. Long story short, he had a LOT of tension when we got him and moved in a way that would be detrimental to his joints and body if it carried on. We've made many physical changes in his body to give him many more years as a performance horse, and it's very visible in these photos!

I asked about Ozempic bc I have recently gained 32 lbs and am now over 50+ lbs overweight, feeling terrible, mentally and physically and nearing pre-diabetes. I absolutely fit the criteria for Semaglatude for weight loss (maybe Mounjaro, not Ozempic), and my insurance covers it. 

This doctor shamed me beyond anything I have ever experienced, told me I should be dieting and exercising and reducing stress, that not all calories are created equally, I should count macros and tons of other generic weight loss tips that I have known since the age of 12. She said I may think I am eating healthy, but if she followed me around with a camera, I am probably not. I have clearly tried ALL of this, many times over, otherwise I wouldn't be there asking for help. 

She went on and on about the unknown risks of this and said she only prescribes for diabetics or BMI of 40+ (which I am under). She said there are so many unknowns, and mentioned pancreatic cancer as her biggest concern, because the drug impacts the pancreas and kept saying""we just don't know what this magic pill does"". I challenged her on it (I have done my research, and didn't think this was a concern) and I said I had heard thyroid cancer mentioned, to which she laughed, condescendingly, and said ""oh, so you're okay with thyroid cancer?"".

She reluctantly prescribed the Rx, then said ""you're probably not gonna be able to get it anyway"" and on the way out she stood in the door and said ""I want you to make a list of the reasons you're taking this medicine. Keep that list, and if you get a serious consequence down the road (like pancreatic cancer), at least you will remember the reasons you took the medicine.

I've been taking ozempic for the past 6 weeks now at 0.25 mg. My binges were not existent the first 4 weeks of taking ozempic, but I was occasionally overeating every 3 days during those first 4 weeks. Of course my body reacted badly and I used to get severe diarrhea whenever I was overeating. The food that I was overeating on was always something sugary, and filled with carbs. I crave them like crazy. The food noises for the binges are gone but those cravings for sugary things is uncontrollable sometimes that I overeating (not binge), example is I would eat 2 50g chocolate bars. Now these past 2 weeks, I'm struggling a lot, I'm binging every 3-4 days but with huge amounts of food (sugary and carbs), man the discomfort that comes after those binges lasts 2 whole days. I get extreme diarrhea to the point I go to the bathroom 10 times per day. The nasty burps, the diarrhea, the pain in the stomach, the full feelings for a whole day makes me so uncomfortable. I have no food noise anymore. I feel like my depression and behavior is leading me to binge. But it's not like before (due to the food noise).

I'm so uncomfortable right now. Feelings full yet it's been hours since I ate. Feeling like vomiting, always having to go the the bathroom every 30 minutes, the burps are so disgusting, that I'm getting so close to vomiting because of the smell.

But no wt loss. No major side effects. As an experiment I had some extra pens and for the past few weeks have been adding clicks so my dose is equal to what the Wegovy max dose 2.4mg would be - to see if that would help me lose wt or suppress appetite.

My blood sugar has had multiple low episodes in the 50’s. And it’s hard to get out of it. I have to eat a bunch of candy to get it back up.

The nausea is a bi\*\*h when it's been awhile since my last meal but generally ok. 

I saw another post wherein she lost almost 5lbs in the first week and her blood pressure readings have gone down as well. How has it been for others?   


For background, I'm 36, female, 218 pounds. (this is my heaviest ever). BP readings are ok at home, horrible at the doctor's office, no issues with blood sugar.   


I'm a bit of a bad eater -- coffee and carb in the morning, lunch would be at 3-4pm and since I eat late, I end up eating either fast food or a lot of food. Dinner is less than 1 (cooked) cup of basmati rice and protein. I do try and get my exercise in. While I'm at home base, I strength train 2-3 times a week and get 9000-10,000 steps a day. when Im on work travels, it gets tricker (so does the eating).   


Sorry this is so long. I'm not sure what to expect and what the ""norm"" is and am looking for a little encouragement as well..  


I guess I'm afraid of getting my hopes up too high on the effects and aid of ozempic then getting disappointed and going into a spiral and gaining even more weight.

Hi there! 33F, 5'3, SW 165, CW I wanna say low 150s? (I'll explain), GW 130

I gained weight because I was hospitalized for severe ocd in 2023 (meds and acute stress made me gain weight).

I started Ozempic on October 26th 2023 and I've been on 0.25 the whole time because I was very responsive to it. I think I must've lost abound 10 pounds since then, I don't weigh myself because then I become obsessive and I've had an eating disorder in the past. Several people told me I lost weight and I definitely feel it in my clothes.

But now I feel like my weight has plateau-ed for the past month and a half. I had a few days where I felt like I lost control over food, I don't know if it's because I'm stressed because I'm starting a new job soon or if it's the medication wearing off.

I'm not the most active right now because we have really harsh winters where I live (Quebec). I know it shouldn't be an excuse though. I should be getting my stationary bike out of storage soon.

Do you think increasing to 0.5 would help? Do you have any other tips for me?

1aew1pc,reddit,r/Ozempic,"Derailed :(. I’ve been on Oz since January 11, and was super proud of myself because I was keeping up my water and protein intake and getting (barely) enough calories, but enough. The last thing I wanted was for this to turn into an unhealthy weight loss due to not eating/lack of appetite.

Well, Sunday things changed. I couldn’t eat, and started experiencing sporadic pain in my side. I tried drinking more, but the liquids would cause the pain to flair up so by the end of the day I was exhausted and nauseous from lack of food and water intake. I thought I’d sleep it off and try again the next day.

Monday morning rolls around and 4am I’m awoken by the pain again, only this time it’s SEVERE. I drink some water and have a warm bath hoping it’ll subside. Nope. Wind up at the ER a few hours later, throwing up aggressively (mostly bile as there wasn’t anything in me!), in excruciating pain. All day I was in the ER getting imaging and pain meds. I was finally discharged with the discovery of a particularly prickly kidney stone that I just need to pass on my own. (I have a history of kidney stones but this one was 10 x’s more painful than any I’ve ever experienced.) 

I go home and try and eat something to get pain meds down - throw up immediately. I try to drink something - throw up immediately. I spend the evening sipping water and having a sporadic spoonful of applesauce here and there, but still wind up throwing up every 30 minutes or so. I give up and sleep through the night, only to wake up vomiting some more. The pain meds are 100% out of my system at this point because I’m petrified of throwing up (Emetophobia). It’s been about 20 hours since my last pain meds, and I still can’t keep anything down. I know the semaglutide isn’t helping because it already makes me nauseous without everything else going on.

I feel completely derailed. I never want to eat again. 😫 I am just so sick. I’ve tried Pepto, tums, zofran, anything to get the nausea down and nothing is working. I feel like I’m dying of thirst and my kidney is killing me and I know I’ll be days of this before it passes.

I’m at a loss for what to do/how to control the nausea so I can get energy and function. I’m a single mom of two school-aged babes that need a mom that can keep up with them. I was doing this for them!

Im still on 0.25 for another 2 weeks so im trying to not feel too bad about not losing more (ik i lost a good amount im just ambitious) and will probably move up to 0.50 and stay there as long as i can.

1b3lgie,reddit,r/Ozempic,"I’m not losing much weight + IBS-C . Hi guys. 
I’ve been on ozempic for 5 months now. I started on 20 clicks / 1mg pen ( if someone can tell me how much per click that’d be great I’m still confused) - I’m on 40 clicks per week now. I’m seeing that it’s a very low dose. Correct me if I’m wrong. I only lost about 13 pounds. I’m not on ozempic for weight loss purposes only, I have a syndrome that affects connective tissue ( EDS ) and it’s caused my body to be so inflamed it spiked cortisol which lead to blood sugar spike which lead to insulin sensitivity which lead to PCOS-like symptoms and covert Cushings which lead to very fast and extremely stubborn weight gain. My endo wants to disrupt that cycle using ozempic to force the blood sugar down and consequently that inflammation. Anyway, with EDS comes IBS, they’re co-morbid. I have IBS mixed but mainly presenting as IBS-C. It’s the reason why I can’t go more than 40 clicks, the flare ups are excruciating. Sometimes I’m doing just fine and I think - I can totally go up to 50-60. But then a flare up proves me wrong. I’m on motility medication. My goal weight is 70Kg ( 154 lbs), I weigh 90kgs (198 lbs).
So far I only lost 13 lbs in 5 months. Isn’t that too low? Appetite is suppressed but not too much. And I work out ALOT. My endo explained that my body is in a fight or flight response and sees weight loss as a direct attack. And is basically holding on to my pudge for dear life. My questions i guess are: is this too little for this much time? Is my dose as low as I think it is?

I've been battling obesity since puberty (11 years old, I am now 29). I've never had success sticking to any diet more than a couple months. 4 years ago I started a low carb OMAD it was really the best year of my life. I felt incredibly energetic and I was losing weight steadily and not struggling with food, since not eating at all felt easier than eating healthy multiple times a day. I stuck to that diet for over a year and lost about 25 kilos.


Then I got pregnant and stopped dieting. Then I was determined to breastfeed and started eating more to help with my low flow. Naturally, I gained weight. And I feel like pregnancy left my body in shambles..After these events I tried to get back on OMAD which used to work so well for me, I couldn't. I have no explanation as to why, I just could not do it. I would feel death starting at my fingers whenever I went a few hours without eating.


So 4 weeks ago I started ozempic after my blood work showed an a1c of 7 but the fasting glucose was still within the normal range. Ozempic made me feel 'normal' again. I didn't even realize that normal people were not battling food thoughts 24/7 until now...I find it now possible to get back on OMAD but I've read so many opinions against it. Anyone can eli5 why I should eat multiple meals a day if I am happy with just one big meal? Anyone can tell me if eating 100g of protein a day and doing some strength training would help prevent muscle loss? Why is rapid weight loss a bad thing if I'm feel okay?

My A1C is down to 5.1 (it was 7.2 when I started and was diagnosed with T2 diabetes). I have lost 97 pounds so far. I have also gone off allllll other prescription medications. I no longer take metformin and I no longer need to take medication for hypothyroidism. 

Now, all that being said, I’ve lost at least half my hair. And it shows no signs of stopping. My weight loss has slowed drastically. I stopped taking Ozempic for about 6 weeks to see if it would help my hair loss. I didn’t notice a difference with my hair, but I did gain back like 15 pounds very quickly. So, I went back on it. 

I saw my doctor recently and he did a full physical to see if we could find the cause of the hair loss. All of my results are within normal range. I’ve posted about this on Reddit before and the responses are always a variation of a few things:  rapid weight loss, malnutrition, lack of protein. And always I’m told ozempic itself does not cause hair loss. 

If it was one of those things, wouldn’t my test results show that? Even my protein levels were normal (even if they were on the lower side of normal). I am terrified of gaining weight back if I stop taking Ozempic. But my hair loss is REALLY affecting me and contributing to my depression. 

I put this as a rant, but I guess I am also looking for some advice/insight if anyone has it.",2024-02-29,64,133,Ozempic

Hi,

I've been using Oz for about 19 months. In the first 4-6 months, I shed more than 30 pounds, but I haven't lost a gram in the last year. 

I eat healthily, avoiding sugar and fried foods. I started crossfit a month ago after a five-year pause. I also walk 4-6 kms daily. I was confident that exercising would help with this never-ending plateau, but nothing has changed.

So I'm here to ask how you stopped plateaus and if you have any suggestions! (Taking 2mg/week is not an option. My endocrinologist  wouldnt accept.)

Also, does anyone know why it can stop working?

1b2vwjx,reddit,r/Ozempic,"My experiences with Ozempic after 2 months / 35lbs loss. Hey guys, I *just* hit the two month mark on my ""Ozempic Journey"" & figured I'd share some of my experiences / results in case it ends up being helpful for anyone else out there interested. I also think it might be cool to be able to revisit this post sometime down the line to see how much further I've progressed or if my opinions change

I'm a 5'7"" 37M with a SW if 260.4lbs, CW is 224.2lb. I started the day after Christmas (so 12/26/2023) whereas today is 02/28/2024. 

I was turned onto Ozempic from my brother & mother, both of whom had apparently been on it for most of 2023. My mother lost something like 70lbs whereas my brother is literally half his size & must have lost almost 100lbs by now. 

When they first suggested it & I started doing research, I was actually pretty hesitant. Especially the idea of injections; not that I mind needles but just the idea of having to do it every week wasnt something I was all the comfortable with. That said, I did my due diligence & read as many studies as I could, read a million Reddit threads etc, but mainly it was hearing (& seeing!) my own family's experiences that got me to give it a shot. I'll say after seeing how incredibly small the needle is + the fact you can't even feel it, that fear went away almost immediately 

For some background, my entire family has always been obese & I was obese throughout childhood *until* my Junior year in HS. I ended up ""fasting"" over a summer (it wasn't called that back then lmao, I always just called it 'going anorexic' tbh) & ended up losing something wild like 70lbs. From there I managed to stay pretty healthy, working outdoors on a farm certainly helped. At my peak I was 155lbs but my normal range was about 170lbs which I maintained for a good decade or so.

Slowly but surely I began to creep back up over the years, especially when I ended up working in a (stressful) office job which put me at around 200 lbs, which I was totally fine with. The real catalyst imo though was COVID. With the lock downs, & probably worst of all, discovering Doordash I quickly ballooned to 220lbs at which point I quit weighing myself (""eh it's an emergency, it's probably good I have extra fat stores!""). When it really became apparent I was getting huge was when I had to start wearing XXL clothing - something I had never ever needed in my life before. I had to buy an entirely new wardrobe just to keep pace! 

My brother encouraged me to weigh myself as I was prepping to begin Ozempic & I was shocked to see I had ballooned all the way up to 260. Even at my fattest as a kid I had never topped 240 so to say this was disheartening would be an understatement. 

Well, deciding it's time to make some positive changes in my life I hit the ground running with the weight loss & have to say I'm incredibly pleased with the results so far. Some random thoughts / experiences / etc I've had along the way include:

- The first week I lost **10lbs**. Yes it was almost entirely water weight but the mental boost it gave was invaluable. I think if anyone is going to compare themselves (which you really shouldn't, I'm not the norm), realize I'm coming from a fairly obese start. Someone starting at 220lb or whatever shouldn't at all expect to lose as much as that fast; however if you're especially big then yes it's *possible* at least 

- Initially I figured 'hey why not use what works & just fast the entire time!' but quickly learned I'm not 17 anymore. More importantly I was able to see consistent weight loss even when still eating + after learning more & thinking about it realized that's probably the least healthy way possible to reach a sustainable goal (not to mention it'd just add stress). It's important to try to keep the longterm in mind, as I don't plan to stay in Ozempic my entire life. 

- For the specific diet, aside from hitting certain macros I honestly don't think it's NEARLY as important as many people put out. It's almost entirely about *calories*, the carbs or fats or fiber etc etc don't really matter in the scheme of things (at least for massive weight loss, not fine tuning in the end). The first month I actually mostly ate corndogs of all things lol & still eat them from time to time. 

- The difference in amounts I ate was stark to say the least. Before starting Ozempic, a typical dinner might be x4 corndogs followed by a other 2-4 once I realized how dank they were. Almost immediately after starting Ozempic even just a single corndog was more then filling. 

- Water, water, water. Luckily I had it drilled in my head by my family to drink enough before even starting, but even without them I was *tremendously* thirsty the first 2 weeks or so & would basically drink an endless amount of water but still end up thirsty. It's since died down but I still make a huge effort to drink 10+ cups a day

- As time went on I did start considering the macro side of things however. I read about the muscle wasting etc & realized it'd be much easier to retain my current muscle (as best I can) versus trying to build it all back after. I've since added protein shakes to my routine & try to hit *at least* 75g a day but preferably eat much more than that. I also began taking Men's Daily Vitamins, as well as adding in a variety of fruits 

- All that said I'm basically following a ~VLCD & aim for about 1200cals a day. The first month I was losing 5+ lbs a week whereas lately it fluctuates from 2-4lb or so. I think this might be a big part of why I've had decent success so far, though everyone is different so this will definitely vary 

- On top of that after about a month I began adding routine exercise to my schedule. Nothing huge, I bought some dumbbells for basic resistance training & then rely on bodyweight exercise otherwise. Squats are my jam! I think this is super important for anyone else who ends up shedding weight as quickly, you want to keep as much of that muscle as you can. I will say, I seem to gain some water weight after esp heavy exercise which made me hesitant at first, but it eventually falls off so I just had to learn to muscle through it basically. I do think with such a high calorie deficit muscle loss is an inevitability either way however 

- Oh yeah, a huge part of my success so far is the fact I was able to almost completely cut out alcohol. I went from a daily drinker of Vodka + juice to basically zero from the moment I began Ozempic. It's true, at least for me, that Ozempic will cut down on *some* of your addictive behaviors. I have practically zero urge to drink either which is.. Wild. 

For side effects, I've been blessed & have had barely any. I'm not sure how much of this is mental or genes or what, as I did have my family reassuring me they had the same experiences & so went in with a positive attitude towards that. I did get a headache the day of my very first injection, but that very well may have been something else (... Infected tooth at the time most likely hah) 

The ""big"" side effect I *have* experienced though, even up to today, is horrible constipation. I've never been all that regular, usually an every other day sort of thing but since starting Ozempic (& likely from the calorie deficit) I've been having a lot of trouble using the restroom even once a week. And I'll tell ya, some of those sh*ts felt almost life altering lmao. Tbh I'm still struggling with this - I added fiber supplements but they haven't seemed to help at all. The last 2 weeks I've actually resorted to Milk of Magnesia. If you're plugged up at all, & need the nuclear option, definitely definitely look into that btw. I'm still trying to figure out a better solution but yeah, that's the main issue I've had so far

One other thing, like a lot of people obese I wasn't too keen on looking at myself in the mirror & especially didn't want to take any pics but I was told by almost everyone to do it so ended up taking a Pic near the beginning & have began taking them every week or two - I'm so glad I did this!! I feel like body dysmoprhia if way more common then we think & so didn't really notice any changes when looking into the mirror until very recently, but looking at the progress pics it was clear as day my gut (& face!) were shrinking. I remember too there was noticeable inflammation in the initial Pic which has almost completely disappeared 

I still have a long way to go - My first goal was 220lb which I'm nearly to. After that I'd LOVE to hit 190lb & then see where the journey takes me. 

This has been by far one of the most positive experiences of my life though. I've been absolutely blessed by having a supportive family & friends behind me, helping to encourage & guide me through the way. The happiest moment so far has to be last weekend, I was able to buy & fit into XL clothing again. I ended up going to a small party with my friends & it was so motivating to hear all the compliments on how different I'm looking etc. None of my old pants fit anymore & almost all my belts are too long. Hell as I write this my pants are almost falling off & I love it lol 


Anyways, I hope this has at least an inkling of helpful info or encouragement for some of you out there. Diet, positive changes, aiming for longterm growth are all important aspects that even I'm still learning every day. 

I want to make it extremely clear that my results aren't typical from what I've seen/read. Every person is unique, coming from a diff starting point etc etc etc so don't get yourself down if you're less or whatever. So long as you're knuckling down & putting in the effort you WILL lose the weight!!

Anyway, I went into my clinic for the third week and thought I was scheduled with a nurse who was going to help me use the pen with the Ozempic again.

No one was available so I had to do it myself.

I went into one of their bathrooms, and when it said to test to see if a little drop came out I pressed the button and a whole bunch came out!

I’m concerned that I used up the entire dosage - except I hadn’t yet set the dose to .25.

I put the needle in and the needle seemed to have gone in and I heard the little “click” saying I was done but I did not feel any of the usual way I feel after getting it.

The next day my appetite has been normal - and I even had a sundae which I haven’t had since I started - couldn’t eat that! And also now a large cheese quesadilla.

I go back into the clinic tomorrow to ask my nurse but something makes me think that that dosage never made it inside of me!

In January I joined, they charged me almost $300, they sent me an EMPTY vial and ignored all of my emails trying to make the situation right, and now they're trying to charge me another $300. I literally have had to call a lawyer, I'm at my wit's end.

My biggest criticism of HenryMeds isn't that I received an empty vial - clearly something unusual happened - but rather the lack of prompt customer service. I understand they're a start-up, but I think they obviously need to hire more people to reply to customer service inquiries.

I see I was downvoted a ton here by people who had great experiences. My only emotion is jealousy! I wish it had worked out, I really do. Sorry to those who felt I was bashing a company that's had a really positive influence in their life.

I'm in a bit of a dilemma and I'm hoping someone who has faced a similar situation can offer some guidance. During my last visit, my doctor prescribed Semaglutide for me. However, the prescription was labeled as ""Semaglutide (Weight Loss),"" which caused the pharmacy to put it through as a weight loss semaglutide and disqualified me from choosing Ozempic. It was automatically processed as Wegovy instead.

Upon contacting my doctor to rectify the issue, the prescription was resubmitted without the ""weight loss"" indication. Once the new prescription was in, the pharmacy called and said it was still put in the same. So again, the pharmacy processed it as Wegovy. When I inquired about this discrepancy with my doctors office, I was informed that it was due to the diagnosis of being overweight, and a reason for the medication was required when my doctor submitted it. I told the nurse that it should have been put in stating it was for other comorbidities : Pre diabetic, high blood pressure etc.

The nurse suggested I ask the pharmacy if they could process it as a generic form, to which they agreed. However, the prescription still appears as Wegovy in my pharmacy app, and the cost is an exorbitant $1,618.99 because my insurance only covers Ozempic, not Wegovy.

I feel like I'm caught in a loop of confusion and frustration. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to navigate this situation? I'm feeling quite defeated and would greatly appreciate any help or advice.",2024-02-28,1,8,Both

Two years prior I was diagnosed with Hashimotos, in 2021 I was diagnosed with fatty liver disease, and 2023 I was diagnosed with PCOS.

I feel so much better and my waistline as well as my wallet thanks me for it! (2) I have had little bouts of energy which i had not been used to. I feel more motivated at work and I noticed my mental fog has improved, and (3) the mental clarity, I feel like I can focus better without having the need to worry about food 24/7.

Luckily it's a holiday weekend and I can sleep in and rest. So far this is the second week in a row that this happened. My eating habits have not changed.

Been on sema since January 1, essentially. Lost 10 pounds. I was really happy with my WL until I talked to my dr and she said I should have lost more by now. I’m already at the full dose, 2M. But that didn’t happen till end of Feb. 

I had a 5mm cyst rupture a few weeks ago, and I couldn’t walk for a week, let alone exercise. I took another week off and then I started going back to hot yoga 3x a week. Before this, I exercises 5x week with hot yoga. It’s a vigorous workout at my studio. I burn at least 400 cals per workout. 

Anyway, my dr said my exercising wasn’t enough and told me to exercise more. I do feel better now and have been going to yoga about 4x a week. I’m trying to add more walks in. She said I need cardio, but I hate running. 

I think my diet is good. I’m def conscious and prob eating less than 1,500 cals a day. 

She said it’s simple math and that if you eat less than you burn you’ll lose weight. A little triggering tbh. 

I could, of course, eat less and exercise more. But I have a history of over exercising  and disordered eating.

1brxyc6,reddit,r/Ozempic,"Is Ozempic making me sick?. I've been on Ozempic for over a year. I'm currently in the hospital and several people in my life are suggesting it is possibly due to the medication. I did tell the doctor that I am on it, but no one at the hospital has mentioned it as a possible reason for my illness.

The illness:  On Thursday night around 6 PM I felt my stomach rumble and had to run to the bathroom.  I had a small amount of diarrhea (I hate the word AND the actual thing) and was very sweaty. I had to lay down on the floor, but as soon as I did, I had to the get back onto the toilet (slipping in my sweat, it was that much).  I did this on repeat about 4-5 times before I finally felt like I was done.  Waiting a few minutes to be sure, I then went upstairs to rinse off in the shower.

When I got out of the shower, I felt that I needed to lay down. But as soon as I did, I had to run to the bathroom.  The toilet filled with blood.  I then had to keep going back to the toilet every few minutes, always having more blood.  I finally called an ambulance to take me to the hospital at 3 am.

I've been here ever since (almost 2 full days later).  The CT scan showed no active bleeding, only some colitis in my lower intestines. They then took a stool sample to send for testing of about 20 viruses/bacteria.  Everything was negative.  I've kept having to go to the bathroom, where it is just blood and mucus (they put me on clear liquids all day yesterday.).

Two GI doctors talked to me today and said most likely it is an infection, just one of thousands that they do not test for.  They said it could take 7-10 days to resolve itself in that case and they allowed me to have solid food and said if it doesn't get worse, I can go home tomorrow possibly. If it does get worse, I will have to stay and have a colonoscopy on Monday. Even If I go home, they'd want me to do a colonoscopy as an outpatient.  I want to know what is causing this, so I will not skip a colonoscopy.

I've been taking the Ozempic 1 mg dose. I only take it every 2+ weeks, because it didn't do much for me for weight loss but it really helps keep my blood sugar stable. (I had gestastional diabetes years ago and was hypogylcemic both before and after that.  I test either with a high A1c OR a high fasting blood sugar but never both at the same time.  However, I was having a really hard time keeping my blood sugar steady before Ozempic so my doctor prescribed it.

Several people that know that I take it have immediately jumped to it as the cause of my illness. I really wish I'd tested positive for one of the bacteria or viral infections so I could be definitive that Ozempic is not the problem.  I don't want to go through this again, and having it just ""work itself out"" means I won't really know for sure what is causing it.",2024-03-31,27,30,Ozempic

My friends who are also insulin resistant and have pcos(if any are here) how as this medication worked for you?

Ozempic is currently “trending” here because so many people have been able to lost a ton of weight thanks to it. I’ve been seeing my doctor since 2020 and she’s never brought it up, even when I thoroughly described my challenges with losing weight. Well, that was until today. She’s certain that taking Ozempic for a couple of months could help kickstart my weight loss journey. According to her, it would make me less hungry, lose around 4 kg per month, and eventually improve my health + make it easier to stick to good habits. I feel sort of tempted to go through it because I’m currently at my highest weight and I just keep gaining more and more. My health is shit right now and both my doctor and I are worried that I’ll soon hit the mark of 100 kg (I’m a short woman), which would make everything much more difficult. However, I’m scared of this medication because I’ve heard that it is meant for people with diabetes, severe obesity and metabolical diseases (I’m sorry if this information is wrong). Also, Ozempic costs almost the minimum wage of my country per month, so I can’t just buy it on a whim. I’m thinking about asking for a second opinion… what do you all think?

My backstory no one asked for lol:   


My Mom died in 2022 and I lost weight because I had no appetite when she first passed for 2 months. Lost weight then the weight came back. Before having a boring lifestyle I was also a size small. Now i'm a medium and it's mostly belly. 11 yrs ago I had my daughter and had gestational diabetes and was ok for years after. But with my Mom ending up sick probably from type 2 complications and not fully taking it seriously (she too was always active but loved her cigarettes) I ended up with type 2 a1c last summer 2023. A1c was a 9! I was livid. So this yr I gave in and asked for ozempic. Doc had me to start at .5 but i'm starting at .25 to see how I feel. I'm not jumping into the deep end of the pool. My hopes are to stay at .25 or .5 the max for a few months then wean off of it and metformin.  


My a1c is not 6.4 on metformin. I'm pre-nursing so I adjust my dose according to my dexcom readings. I need less metformin now which is good. With ozempic I plan to only be on it until I can get back to my proper weight for my short height and my a1c back to a normal range. I know it can be done as I prefer not to be on any meds. I'm 44 so exercising and diet isn't enough right now as i'm also menopausal (yup life has been really good to me recently).",2024-04-30,0,11,Ozempic

I’ve been nauseous all day plus clearing 4-5 days of constipation from a very gurgly angry tummy. 

Tried some ginger candy for nausea but threw it up. Threw up some nauzene as well. I even bought an electric anti nausea bracelet (for sea sickness and morning sickness) but still feel really queasy. 

I’m home alone with my toddler this week bc my husband has to help his parent move to assisted living. I just can’t be this sick while wrangling a toddler. He’s not a particularly obedient child and I almost cried today when I could feel an explosive poop coming and he wouldn’t come inside so I could use the bathroom.

I am so glad for people who this medication helps, I really hoped to be one.

I have lost about 10 lbs since starting Wegovy and I think that’s all I can hold on for. Will do my best to keep going with the lighter eating habits I started over the last 8 weeks.

1cgi5v4,reddit,r/Ozempic,"10 days in. M42. SW 208. 6ft. Slightly obese. Pre diabetic headed to diabetic. Been on Metformin for a few years now. Thought I’d share an update. 

Before starting. Took months to go even ask my doctor. Should have done it earlier. Was apprehensive about a new drug. But this has been around for a while and there is good data. Side effects are all known and manageable. 

Week 1. Was a bit anxious about self dosing.  Needles and all. It was so easy. Didn’t feel a thing. In fact for the first couple of hours I was wondering did I even get the dose in. Then I felt a headache coming along. So I knew I had done it right. 
Headache on day 1 and 2 is the only real side effect I have had. 0.25 dose. No nausea constipation or anything else. 
Unfortunately no appetite suppression also. Well marginal I would say.
Day 1, 2 and 3 I felt I could go 3-4 hours and not need to snack. But was this just me trying to control myself? I don’t know. 
By day 6 I had no effects of the drug. This is pretty common I hear. 
All week my weight fluctuated between 208 and 205. I ended up at 207. But did I really lose 1 lb? I was more conscious about my eating all week. Fiber and protein. So maybe it was just that. 

Week 2. Took my second 0.25. Same as before headache. But only day 1. Still no appetite suppression. Weighed jn 205 today but honestly this is just a result of a great bowel movement.  

Overall I am a little disappointed. All the reposts here had my expectations and hopes set a little high. 
I have realized 0.25 is it an effective dose for me. 0.5 at the 5 week mark we shall see. Maybe it will really kick in at 1.0. 

My message to others. If you are on the fence, take the plunge. Temper your expectations in the results. On the flip side the side effects may also be minimal.",2024-04-30,3,4,GLP-1

First off, please spare any rude comments. I already feel like enough of an idiot & I’ve already been beating myself up about this all day and feeling mildly panicked.

Shockingly, I haven’t had any negative side effects aside from my very first dose (to be expected when your first injection ever is 2.5mg) & the last few days I’ve had some pretty bad abdominal pain/nausea throughout the night but it subsides in the morning.

Hey everyone, I’m 19 years old and curious to if you guys think Ozempic can help me lose weight (of course I’m going to go to a doctor for an opinion, but thought I’d ask everyone here also). I’m around 5’4 and have weighed 175lbs for a while (though sometimes it fluctuates to 170 or 180). I am on both birth control and Zoloft (antidepressant), which has made me gain a lot of weight (used to be around 135 before I went on both of them, but can’t get off either due to medical reasons) alongside making it difficult to shed off. I don’t typically eat much out of the ordinary, usually one or two meals a day with little snacks in between (like yogurt, fruit, chips and/or chocolate but small amounts, though I have cut them out before, etc). I will say I have sensory processing disorder so I can’t eat as healthy as I’d like due to only liking certain foods, but I try my best to at least balance that out with eating less overall. I have also stopped eating snacks/desserts like ice cream, though I will say in school I have a tendency to drink a lot of soda and sugary coffee when I am stressed and need to work, though usually that would be only one bottle (or less) of whichever it is, with only one meal that day and with drinking a lot of water as well. My mom thinks that I only have gained weight due to the soda but I’m not sure. Overall though, I have seen no change in my weight even when I restrict my food intake a ton and go long periods without soda. I also am a bit active as I live in a city and need to walk to class every day, but I don’t directly exercise due to school keeping me busy, though I hope to this summer. 


I am mainly confused because when I weighed 135, my eating habits were the same if not worse, alongside me going out a lot less, and yet it was easy for me to maintain that weight, which is why I do think it may be due to my medication?


My weight has been making me insecure as my clothes lately have been fitting tightly and I am even unable to wear some of my pants or shorts due to them no longer fitting. I have tried eating very little each day but again there is never any change, if anything it feels like I am gaining weight. My mother also frequently blames my weight gain on my habits, even when I don’t eat. She tells me to eat less even when I literally can’t.

Ive lost 50lbs just before covid with what felt like a herculean effort and I just couldn't maintain it. All day, every day revolved around planning every bite.

Know anyone with Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease and/or chronic kidney disease who wants to take a GLP-1 medication?

Lilly recently launched has a 5-year-long retatrutide trial trial recruiting 10k participants worldwide. For those who don’t know, trial participants on retatrutide lost [about 24% of their body weight (or ~58lbs) in the phase two trials](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/lillys-next-obesity-drug-just-cut-average-58-pounds-prompting-all-phase-3-blitz).

> *The Effect of Retatrutide Once Weekly on Cardiovascular Outcomes and Renal Function in Adults Living With Obesity (TRIUMPH-OUTCOMES)* [NCT06383390](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06383390)

BIG THINGS TO KNOW:

- The trial is 5 years long 🙌

- Must be at least age 45 with a BMI of ≥27.0 kilograms per meter squared (kg/m^2)

- Participants may be with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D) unless their hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is 10% or lower

- As best I can tell, the odds of getting retatrutide is 50%

for the past 3-4 years I’ve been losing weight without any aid. I’ve yo-yo’d from my goal weight twice (losing 50 lbs both times). Because of this I’ve become impatient and emotionally exhausted.

I’m about 25 lbs or so away from my goal weight and I’ve learned a lot about my relationship with food , as well as the value of exercise at the gym.

My questions for you guys are the following

1. How bad is your food aversion while taking the medication, and do you think this aversion could contribute to ruining a more healthy/delicate relationship with food beyond taking the drug? 

2. How often do you need to inject, and how long have you waited to see the results you’re looking for? Do you think you could lose that weight without the drug now? 

3. Because I’m so close to my goal weight and have been losing weight without ozempic (outside of my impatience), would you or would you not recommend it for someone like myself?

4. What are your plans to take care of yourself after you’ve reached your goal weight, or do you see yourself taking the medication again if things get worse off for you?

I resumed my split dose regimen this week (on Sunday and Thursday) after being off the medicine due to the colonoscopy last week. I have barely any side effects this time around which is great! My question is my doctor told me to increase my dose to 0.50mg in the split dose fashion. I have not been on this medication consistently because of the colonoscopy and I don’t think I should be increasing my dose that fast? Any thoughts?

1d4x1ue,reddit,r/Ozempic,"2 months in...questions about weight loss and dosage and insurance and tips. My first ever shot was on 03/29 at 0.25. I did the 4 weeks at 0.25 and then moved up to 0.50 (04/26). My doctor advised staying on 0.50 as long as I want to but also has a concern that my insurance may require a separate pre-authorization to move up the dosage. I do not know if that is true. She left it up to me to contact her if I want to up the dose.

As for weight, I did initially lose about 7 lbs over the first 3-4 weeks. But since the end of April I have lost nothing. I have stayed right at the same weight (within a pound) for over 5 weeks now. (My BMI is over 40, so it's not like I'm trying to lose a few vanity pounds.)

The good news is that I have had minimal side effects. 

fwiw, I have been insulin resistant/PCOS for years and years and years and 2 years ago my A1C tipped me into officially being diabetic. I did get my A1C down to 5.7 range only on metformin.

So now the questions:

1. Has anyone had to get a new pre-authorization to go up in dose? ie. to go from 0.50 to 1.0?

2. Who else had such minimal loss at early doses and did going up to 1.0 make a noticeable difference?

3. For those with slow loss to start, what made the most difference? Increased dose? Diet...low carb? Exercise? Did you end up doing all 3? 

I'm essentially leaning towards messaging my doctor next week that I want to try increasing the dose. But I am aware that I likely need to pay more attention to what I am actually eating and movement.",2024-05-31,0,5,GLP-1

I have been obese my whole life. 
I have been on every diet imaginable since being 12 years old. Nothing works or is maintainable.
I lost 70lbs a year or 2 ago due to having extremely low iron and i struggled to eat.
 I gained some back. 
Losing weight is so difficult I have to basically starve to loose weight. I have isuline resistantance to thank for that. 
Anyway Question. I'm doing keto...again,  I am already eating under 20 carbs a day and doing intermittent fasting. I eat a small snack of keto bread and eggs or simaler and a protein with salad or veg. That's it. One meal and a snack per day. 
I am losing weight slowly. 
If I take ozempic will it make me lose more or just stop me from being hungry? 
I am going back to my Endocrinologist in June. She has offered me it before but would it be worth it for me? 
I want to speed up the weight loss as I have gallstones and I'm in pain everyday. The surgeon said he won't operate  because my bmi is too high!! He told me to get bariatric surgery which isnt covered by my private insurance  and is 15k where I live so that won't happen.

1d4lsqn,reddit,r/Ozempic,"ozempic doesn't act on the gut, it works in the brain. The Atlantic published an article titled ['The Science Behind Ozempic is Wrong'](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/03/ozempic-glp1-weight-loss-brain-gut/677645/) that was deliberately (and almost offensively) clickbait-y, though there's an important clarification in it about what we're learning about why Ozempic is so effective. We've known for years that the gut releases a hormone called GLP-1, which helps people feel full. Scientists believed that if you could introduce more of that drug to a person's body, it would help them lose weight, because they'd eat less. But since GLP-1 breaks down quickly in the gut, it likely doesn't affect our appetites. What DOES affect our appetite is the presence of GLP-1 and the receptors that bind it, in our brains- ozempic and the other drugs in its class work on our brains, which is tantalizing. The effect has to be studied further, since GLP-1 drugs don't cross the blood-brain barrier, yet they're still clearly having some effect on it. 

There are implications for wider application for myriad conditions, including addiction, from which many ozempic users have already reported some relief. Endocrinologist Daniel Drucker, of Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, [believes that the GLP-1 produced in the gut controls inflammation](https://erictopol.substack.com/p/daniel-drucker-illuminating-the-glp) in places like the liver, blood vessels and heart, even though those are all areas where there are few GLP-1 receptors, after observing reduced inflammation at those sites; reduced inflammation often preceded weight loss, or it happened even when weight loss didn't occur. We know that chronic inflammation is linked to a number of health conditions, and **if** we can gain a better understanding of how to systemically reduce or control that inflammation with GLP-1 use, we may one day even be able to slow the progression of conditions like Parkinson's. It's an absolutely fascinating prospect, and it could make millions of people healthier...if we could just figure out how to reduce the issues of drug access and cost.",2024-05-31,95,42,Ozempic

Or am I just SOL with all the GLP agonists?. **Background**: Since having kids, like basically everyone in the world, my weight has been slowly creeping up. I've always had a super fast metabolism and used to eat as much as I wanted and stayed skinny. Old age and inactivity are finally catching up with me, and I've been in the overweight range for the past 5 years or so. 

I also am pretty much an alcoholic. I'm functioning, a good dad/husband, have a good job and don't make unsafe decisions but I drink a lot. Maybe 40-50 beers/week. I started thinking GLP agonists might be my best bet for getting my drinking under control. So, since January I actually gained a bit of weight on purpose (not at all hard to do anymore, haha) so that I would weigh in at the obese range and get a prescription.

**The question:** At my last check up I ""made weight"" and asked the doctor to prescribe me ozempic/wegovy/whatever. He chose ozempic. Insurance came back asking for prior authorization and denied it. Now, after reading, it seems like ozempic might have been the wrong choice because I'm not diabetic. Wegovy, on the other hand, seems approved as a weight loss drug. I'm not sure why the doctor chose ozempic, are there other reasons I don't know about? Do I have a chance of getting Wegovy covered?

I am extremely fortunate that I can actually afford $1100/month (I'll save half that on beer $$ anyway), so I just wanted to ask whether my insurance would be more likely to approve Wegovy or some other than it was ozempic. I think I am just going to pony up for this first month regardless, because I want to get started and I assume it will take a whole bunch of time if I go back to square one with a new prescription (for example it took a month just to receive this first month of ozempic), but please let me know if you have advice on other options I should research.",2024-05-30,0,5,Both

1d4a50k,reddit,r/Ozempic,"No appetite at ALL & scary nutritionist advice … help?. Hi everyone! Using a throwaway since some friends & family know my main & would judge me for being on this medication (🙃).

I went up to 0.5 a few days ago after 4 weeks on 0.25; I had started to experience some appetite suppression with the last two doses but thankfully minimal negative side effects.

However, one thing I have noticed is that (in the mornings especially) I really have NO appetite. As part of getting the Oz prescription I had to be referred to a nutritionist. I met with her yesterday and (surprise, surprise) she hates both Ozempic and Vyvanse, both of which I’m on and have no plans to discontinue. I disregarded most of her fear-mongering about Oz overriding hunger cues (after a loooong history of disordered eating + the Vyvanse, I never had them anyway & won’t be recovering them probably!!!) 

But one thing she did say that made me SCARED was that she’s had patients on Ozempic who have so little appetite on the higher doses it damages their metabolism, and causes them to burn muscle during workouts rather than build it. I am very active (spin and pilates, some light weight training) and was even before Ozempic, so this is big for me. She kept talking about how she was happy to give me meal plans now but she would also make a plan for if I decide to go off the Ozempic, etc. Was sort of weird, even if I’m not surprised that Miss Goop didn’t approve of my medication choices.

I’m trying my best to keep my protein up but … I have been noticing the last couple weeks that my performance in cardio workouts is down. My stamina isn’t as there, even if 10 lbs off makes it a bit easier.

Last year, I saw my primary care doctor to see if semaglutide would be a good medication for me. She said my obesity combined with my sugar addiction made me a perfect candidate for the meds. However, my insurance wouldn't cover it. You know how this goes. 

I went back to her twice over the past year to try to discuss alternatives. At this last appointment, I finally asked her more questions about the compounded drug. She, for ethics reasons, couldn't recommend or not recommend that I take the compounded version, but she told me that most of her patients who are on the compounded version only have side effects that she would have expected from the real drug. I asked her what's the worse that could realistically happen to me if I take the compounded version. She went back and forth a bit, but then said that the worst side effect she's seen is pancreatitis. I mentioned this to my therapist who said pancreatitis is ""kill me now levels of pain."" She is normally very precise in her language and tries to avoid making suicide references casually, so that really scared me. I have a low pain tolerance.

I looked up some compounding pharmacies and found University Compounding Pharmacy looked the safest to me. They've been in business 20 years and say they only buy from FDA approved vendors. So I went ahead and had the prescription sent there.

I'm 30F and went through a lot that made me gain weight. Long story short, doing keto for messed up my metabolism, getting pregnant, developing a hormonal disease (prolactinoma) and going through some big life changes.

I have a history of emotional eating but I don't believe it is the main cause of my 50lb weight gain. My weight for most of my life prior to this was stable at 130-140lb/29"" waist, while dealing with emotional eating. Therefore, I believe the reasons above are the biggest perpetuators: age, slower metabolism and hormonal issues. 

I have reactive hypoglycemia and I am often on a blood sugar rollercoaster which affects my energy. My endocrinologist asked me to monitor when I have these episodes. However he does not believe I should take Ozempic because he thinks if I stop it, I will just regain the weight.

My argument is that I want to use Ozempic as a tool to help me lose weight alongside other life changes. As it stands, I have been unable to shed significant amounts of weight by myself despite having an average of 10K steps a day, exercising 3x a week, eating balanced while focusing on protein and fibre (for the most part), paying attention to my hunger and satiety cues, you name it. I feel like I have the tools to know what works for me and how to take care of myself. But there are factors inhibiting my ability to lose fat, mainly hormonal issues. I do take cabergoline for my prolactinoma but even though my levels are normal now I have not lost weight unfortunately.

Is this a good idea??? I want to find my confidence again. I'm having such a hard time deciding if I should do it (I got a script through Livewell in Canada).

1dsfluq,reddit,r/Ozempic,"Questions, Opinions, Reassurance, Shared Experiences. **Background:**

I have battled with disordered eating when I was younger and developed habits of hardly eating anything throughout the day. In my adolescence and being a young adult, it was intentional where I did severe calorie restriction, went through ups and downs in body weight. When I got older it became a habit that I could go throughout the day without eating. I hardly ate anything but when I did eat socially I would eat a fair bit. When I really got into fitness I had to **really** be on top of reminding myself to eat regularly and prioritizing protein. I worked out for **years** 5-6 days a week with little to no changes. I watched as my gym buddies bodies fluctuated during their cuts and bulks and I felt completely defeated when my body never changed and I was monitoring my nutrition. I worked out more than they did and they had very visible changes while my body didn't move and I still stayed 'obese'. I've felt so defeated for years. I finally considered Ozempic wondering if it could help regulating my hormones, prevent/reverse prediabetes and/or handling underlying issues I may be having.

My first shot was on May 7th, 2024. I did 3 shots at 0.25MG, 4 shots at 0.50MG and 1 shot at 1.0MG (on my first week) with SW @ 192.3LBS CW:191.2LBS GW: 130-135LBS (I'm 5'4)

**Symptoms**

* Extreme Fatigue (present throughout all shots - has been the hardest thing to deal with second to the depression)
* Depression Amplified - this was a huge concern for me
* Increased Hunger and cravings (are we not supposed to feel the opposite effect?)
* Constipation (worse at 0.25MG)

I have been struggling **a lot** with the depression and fatigue. It is my hobby and passion to workout regularly but I haven't had the physical or mental capacity to go back to the gym the past few weeks (which is probably adding to the depressive symptoms)

In the past, I never craved and/or had so many urges to eat **this much** and eat certain things as I do now and I ALWAYS made time for the gym even on some of my toughest times but with this amplified depression and fatigue I've almost given up efforts in weight loss simply because I don't have energy and the reality of 'nothing working' for me just sort of overwhelmed me.

I have not loss any weight but have only had 8 shots so far and only took my first 1.0MG on Thursday of this week.

Does anyone have any advice on how to manage the symptoms - fatigue, depression. Any stories to share on your journey? Did you too feel as though nothing was working but it started working for you at some point? Did this not work for you at all? Should I consider coming off of it? What are your thoughts on my current situation? How did you manage overall? Was it worth it to you?

I've been on ozempic for weightloss since the start of the year, stating weight 146kg, current weight 123kg, so things have been going great.... For the first couple of months. 

I'm on 1mg for a good while now, had almost no side effects, but also, now almost no more effect either. 
I'm back at my old sugary shenanigans for a few weeks, I still get a tiny bit of appetite suppression, but the cravings are back full force, and I'm struggling hard to get back on track.

I still have a ton of weight to lose, but with the effects of ozempic being rather weak currently, it is back to the good old 'willpower' thing, which is not my strongest suit, else I'd not have spent the majority of my adult years being morbidly obese. 

So I'm turning to you all for opinions and advice, thinking others must have found themselves in similar situations with ozempic after a while (even if I suspect it is taking most people longer than just 6 months to arrive there)

I'm in Ireland, which only allows for 1mg dosis as the max, so going up in dose isn't an option. (only approved weight loss drug apart from ozempic is saxenda, so no wegovy or anything here.)

I've been wondering if taking a break for a few weeks and restarting from 0,25 would work? I'm currently spending a lot of money on pens that I nullify by eating like crap again, so stopping for the moment seems like a reasonable decision, and then restarting and hopefully having the effects of ozempic back again for a while, before I get completely used again to the max dosis?

Anyone tried it? Is that something that worked for you? How many weeks of break would make sense? Did you feel the effects again after being off and back on? 


I'm super sad and also angry at myself to find myself in this situation, I've made such fantastic progress in the first 4-5 months and I feel so much healthier and better with that weight off, and with following a healthy diet. Ozempic has been a genuine life changer - while it worked. 
I even do feel like crap physically now that I'm back at fatty and sugary foods, so there's clear consequences but something in my head will just always cave to the cravings instead of logic.

1ds8djf,reddit,r/Ozempic,"2 month in - going on a break? . Hello, 29y f here, I‘m on Ozempic since beginning of may, so a little less than two month in, and I lost around 7 kg, so around  15 lbs since then. I just wanted to share my journey and maybe ask for some advice. I started at 85 kg, I always have been overweight, though not extremely obese, but never felt good in my body and never have been considered attractive. Actually my diet never was  extremely unhealthy, have been vegetarian since 20 years, always exercising and no weight related health struggles so far except for fucked up knees. But I always kept loosing and gaining the same 10 kilos, because I’m always super hungry and use food for comfort. Even though I knew that eating for comfort was wrong I just couldn’t change it for longer periods - there was always something that brought me back to old patterns, like a bad breakup or covid, or very stressful times job wise. I think Ozempic really helped me to understand where my behaviour problems started and what exactly it was that I was looking for in food. Right now I feel very good and confident about the weight lost - I think I could be loosing faster? But I often feel dizzy, weak and without focus during the day so I might have to try to eat a little bit more. 
And this is also my problem - I feel like I’m not really able to focus enough for “enjoying” my summer? I also had to quit drinking completely, alcohol just makes me sick after one sip. This really messes up my personal life right now, I’m just sooooo tired during the day, if I manage to go out with friends in the evening I just sit around and wait until it’s acceptable for me to go home and sleep lol. Also when going on dates, I just feel like I lost interest in many “fun” things, I don’t get exited anymore about spending time with my friends or on dates. Not in a depressing way - I don’t feel bad or anything - but like spikes of happiness are missing. So now I stopped dating because I cannot get in the right mood anyway. 
I’m afraid of missing a great time and my last summer before turning 30 because I worry to much about my looks or my weight… on the other hand I’m so happy about my old clothes fitting again and feeling way more confident about my appearance. I’m an Artist, so going out at night / socialising etc. is essential part of my job as well - but going to a gallery opening, even the thought of it, makes me want to go to sleep already. 
So I thought about going on a break until mid of august and then restarting again with the injections - so I can have a break from weight loss and maybe catch some fresh air and not be to hard on my body. On the other hand it will be over sooner if I just stick to it and lose another 10 kgs. 
And yes - I know hydration and electrolytes are important, I also try to eat enough protein :D 
Maybe some of you have the same thoughts? I don’t experience any other side effects other from fucked up sleeping / fatigue and brain fog. But I also started clenching my jaw at night - which results in heavy headache every day for the first 4 - 5 hours after waking up.",2024-06-30,1,2,Ozempic
1ds8d30,reddit,r/Ozempic,"Ozempic & THC. Just wanted to drop a quick note to anyone who uses Ozempic and is a THC user. 

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is real and very much kicking my ass. I started taking Ozempic a month ago - now on .5mg. The nausea and vomiting was so severe I got so dehydrated I had to get rushed to a hospital. 

Not all THC users get CHS (quite rare generally) but with the nausea and vomiting from CHS then the nausea from ozempic made it a not-so-nice experience. Didn’t and couldn’t eat for 7 days. 

Have to stop all THC consumption moving forward. 

I would have never guessed CHS and would have just blamed it on the Ozempic. Apparently, doctors have seen bad cases of CHS in users while taking Ozempic. Just creates a plethora of problems in your gut apparently. 

Otherwise, Ozempic has been amazing for me.

Just wanted to spread awareness just in case anyone is a similar vote. I’ve lost 16lbs in a month, and unfortunately, a lot of that was from the CHS ruining my insides.",2024-06-30,36,27,Ozempic

1ds7sg4,reddit,r/Ozempic,"Livewell review for Canadians.. I'm in NB with out a family DR, so options were limited to get Ozempic. I read the reviews about Livewell and while they were not great all the other suggestions I found were not available for NB.

With Livewell everything is done by chat/message, they don't have video calls or phone calls. The time to reply to a message was roughly 24 hours. I filled out their questions and uploaded the requested photo. I had to try a couple of photos as they said they couldn't see my body composition. This was because I don't own tight fitting clothes but the side profile finally worked for them. I have a BMI of 35.9 with mild high blood pressure.

Next they asked for blood work to ensure I was suitable. I got that done at a clinic and because NB give you access to your blood results I was able to upload it to them. In Hindsight asking Livewell for the fax or email might have been a better option. 

In my case the blood work showed that I have high Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT). They further said it might be nothing but its enough to make me not suitable for their services and I should follow up with a doctor. Google says ALT is a sign of possible liver problems but you need to investigate to see what is causing it, which I am doing.

So no, Livewell didnt provide me a prescription and that sucks but I'm also glad they are not just approving everybody. I was also not charged for their service. 

I did notice when opening the bookmark for their site I often didnt need to log in again. I'm no computer expert but that did concern me a bit regarding security of personal info.",2024-06-30,1,6,Ozempic
1ds7bnd,reddit,r/Ozempic,"‘Metabolism reset’ question …. New to the subreddit and appreciative of the many discussions, thank you!

A question after a lot of reading (in this sub) - there seems to be a many comments about how the main point is to use Ozempic (or equivalent) to help with a calorie deficit )and hence, weight loss) but very little (actually, I haven’t seen any posts about this) about how the medicine is supposed to (as I’ve read elsewhere?) help reset the body’s metabolism/weight to a lower level.

As in, if I have (say) 40 excess pounds more than ‘my ideal weight’, it’ll try and keep it there (if not slowly increase over time) even with ‘proper diet and exercise’ (said equivalently, ‘eat less and exercise more’ really isn’t valid when your body is set at a particular weight) … is my understanding of Ozempic (semiglutide) wrong that if I do lose those 40 pounds (or a decent percent of that), my body will then ‘reset’ (at least some extent) to the new weight?

I completely changed how and what I eat because fatty foods or even some of the healthy ones made my stomach painfully bloated and gassy. Even things like peanut butter or corn tortilla chips. (I'd get up to go to the bathroom at night and the top of my belly would spasm and be extremely painful to the point I'd make myself throw up to alleviate the pain).

I took it for 9 ish months and went from 160 ish to 135 ish. I was also doing low carb and high protein/ fat. My insulin resistance got turned around, and my gallbladder crapped out on me so I stopped taking the medicine. I then gained back my weight plus some.

I would think these two medications together would help me to be losing weight. the last time I took this medicine I just stayed on the low .25 dose the entire time. I don’t eat any particular way currently. If it sounds good I’ll eat it, I do eat way less than I use to though.

Said that for a little backstory, was overweight for 5 years until a friend told me about this ozempic medicine thing.

Two weeks ago, I was 120 kg and I started taking it (badly, took 1 mg instead of 0.25 because I didn't realize your not supposed to start on the dose they give you, you should ease your body in until it gets accostumed to it so that was a fun 3 days, puking my guts out and not being able to eat) but today I'm the thinnest I have been in 3 years with 114.6 kg, which isn't a lot but hey, it's only been 2 weeks, I'm guessing that's kind of a good thing and it might be mostly water weight.

Now, I need some advice. Like I said I'm a big picky eater and I saw some pics on the internet of something called Ozempic head and searched some fitness guys saying that if we don't want our head to look like that we should eat a lot of protein and work out.

Now, my diet for the last two weeks has been: Half a measuring cup (the one that comes with the rice cooker) of rice. One can of tuna 3 chicken sausages A lot of hot sauce

And I eat that twice a day, mix it all in like a slightly disgusting risotto. And that's it.

If I keep up with this, is it enough for me to not get that ozempic head? Should I add something?

1drn7t7,reddit,r/Ozempic,"Questions, Opinions, Reassurance, Shared Experiences. **Background:** 

I have battled with disordered eating when I was younger and developed habits (though not intentional) of hardly eating anything throughout the day. In my adolescence and being a young adult, it was intentional where I did severe calorie restriction, went through ups and downs in body weight. When I got older it became a habit that I could go throughout the day without eating. I hardly ate anything but when I did eat socially I would eat a fair bit. When I really got into fitness I had to **really** be on top of reminding myself to eat regularly and prioritizing protein. I worked out for **years** 5-6 days a week with little to no changes. I watched as my gym buddies bodies fluctuated during their cuts and bulks and I felt completely defeated when my body never changed and I was monitoring my nutrition. I worked out more than they did and they had very visible changes while my body didn't move and I still stayed 'obese'. I've felt so defeated for years. I finally considered Ozempic wondering if it could help regulating my hormones, prevent/reverse prediabetes and/or handling underlying issues I may be having. 

My first shot was on May 7th, 2024. I did 3 shots at 0.25MG, 4 shots at 0.50MG and 1 shot at 1.0MG (on my first week) with SW @ 192.3LBS CW:191.2LBS GW: 130-135LBS

**Symptoms**

* Extreme Fatigue (present throughout all shots - has been the hardest thing to deal with second to the depression)
* Depression Amplified - this was a huge concern for me 
* Increased Hunger and cravings (are we not supposed to feel the opposite effect?) 
* Constipation (worse at 0.25MG) 

I have been struggling **a lot** with the depression and fatigue. It is my hobby and passion to workout regularly but I haven't had the physical or mental capacity to go back to the gym the past few weeks (which is probably adding to the depressive symptoms)

In the past, I never craved and/or had so many urges to eat **this much** and eat certain things as I do now and I ALWAYS made time for the gym even on some of my toughest times but with this amplified depression and fatigue I've almost given up efforts in weight loss simply because I don't have energy and the reality of 'nothing working' for me just sort of overwhelmed me. 

I have not loss any weight but have only had 8 shots so far and only took my first 1.0MG on Thursday of this week. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to manage the symptoms - fatigue, depression. Any stories to share on your journey? Did you too feel as though nothing was working but it started working for you at some point? Did this not work for you at all? Should I consider coming off of it? What are your thoughts on my current situation? How did you manage overall? Was it worth it to you?

A1C was 11.8, with a fasting glucose of 450!!

Cholesterol was 254, triglycerides 197, LDL 173

TSH was 11.8 

I immediately started on Ozempic (was already on metformin), upped my levothyroxine dose, and began intensive lifestyle changes.  I now workout 30-90 minutes 5-6 days per week, with 2-3 days of strength training and cardio at least 5 days.  I have been eating 1400-1600 calories per day, trying to average 100g protein and under 100-150g carbs.  I’ve been paying attention to fiber more and watching the total carbs in any given meal to keep them under 40-50 and always pairing with protein and fat.  

It’s been 11 weeks.  I have lost just over 20 lbs.  I had new blood work yesterday and it showed massive improvement!!

New A1C 6.6 (down from 11.8)

Fasting glucose was 106 (down from 450)

Cholesterol is still high, but has dropped significantly:
Total cholesterol- 211 (down 43)
Triglycerides- 113 (in normal range, down 84)
LDL - 152 (down 21)

TSH is now normal range


I still have a lot of work to do, but I am so happy to see the hard work paying off.  I was really scared after my appointment and there was a part of me worried that it was too late and I had caused too much damage to my body.  This gives me hope and motivation to stick to my changes!

1eh5h0y,reddit,r/Ozempic,"Anxiety on Ozempic. I've been on GLP-1 medications since January. My doctor wanted me to lose some weight, and I jokingly asked him about Ozempic. I didn't need to lose much, but he started me on Zepbound.



A little backstory: My entire life, I've suffered from extreme stomach pain due to multiple food allergies. I'm celiac and went gluten-free about 10 years ago, but the stomach aches persisted despite a full diet change and careful eating.



When I started Zepbound in January, I quickly noticed the stomach aches disappeared. The weight loss didn't matter as much as finding a solution to my stomach problems. However, I started experiencing concerning side effects, like severe dizziness. I told my doctor, and he switched me to Ozempic. Initially, the stomach aches returned because of the low dose, but as I gradually increased it, they disappeared. Unfortunately, the dizziness came back, and I started experiencing depression, extreme anxiety, and panic attacks out of nowhere. Panic attacks are the worst feeling of impending doom; I can't live like this.



One night, I got up because my dog was barking and collapsed from being lightheaded/dizzy, hitting my head and scaring my wife to death. I cut back on the medication, and the stomach aches instantly resumed. It feels like a no-win situation: I can't cut the dose because the stomach aches return, but I can't live with the anxiety or the dizziness. It's not worth it.



I have an appointment with my doctor next week. He recommended Lexapro, but I'm not depressed or anxious—this isn't my normal state. The anxiety and panic come out of nowhere, sometimes while I'm just watching TV.



I know many of you have experienced similar side effects. Have you found any solutions? I don't want to lose weight; I'm on a maintenance dose because it’s been an absolute cure for my stomach. To put it in perspective, I've had stomach aches five out of seven days every week for 37 years. Since starting these medications, I've only had maybe three stomach aches.

Ozempic is my last resort and my only hope, i’m afraid there’s too much riding on it and if it fails i will go into depression. I know this is stupid but my heart feels heavy at the thought of it not working. If someone here went through the same type of anxiety before starting Ozempic, please tell me how you dealt with it and what should i do with these thoughts. I need some hope, that’s all.

Week 2: 0.25mg

Week 3: 0.25mg

Week 4: 0.25mg

Week 5: 0.50mg

Pen 2 is same as pen 1.

Week 7: 0.50mg

Week 8: 0.50mg (this week)

Week 9 should be 1mg, which is what's left in the pen, but it only goes up to 0.50mg per injection, so I would need to give myself two 0.50mg injections.

I imagine if I had the right size pen, I would get 1mg all in one go. 

Alternatively, I'm not looking for medical advice; I'm just looking at other people's experiences. Should I ride out two more weeks of 0.50mg if it's working for me?

At this point when people ask me how I’m losing so much weight I just tell them I’m hitting the gym a lot.

Obviously I’ve changed my diet tremendously when I began the drug. No more fast food or sweets at all. Maintaining a calorie deficit. Making sure I’m getting at least 100g of protein a day. Between eating clean and the side effects I get every time I up my dose, I’d say this isn’t exactly easy!

It’s not a magic pill that makes you feel amazing the second you take it and lets you eat whatever you want. You need to make major lifestyle changes to see results and I don’t think that we should be written off as lazy just for taking a drug that helps us.

1egsi9j,reddit,r/Ozempic,"How does Ozempic work?. With the breakthroughs in GLP-1 drugs, I became interested in how they work. I made this graphic that was useful for me and wanted to share it with you all!

**(1)** When food is consumed, it begins to break down in the stomach and small intestine.  
**(2)** The breakdown of food, particularly carbs, leads to an increase in blood glucose levels.  
**(3)** Cells in the small intestine respond by secreting the hormone GLP-1.  
**(4)** GLP-1 travels through the bloodstream and binds to GLP-1 receptors on the pancreas, which causes pancreas to produce insulin. Insulin then lowers blood glucose.  
**(5)** Insulin promotes the uptake of glucose by tissues, especially muscle and fat cells, for energy use or storage. In the liver, insulin promotes the conversion of glucose into glycogen for storage. All of this leads to a decrease in blood glucose levels.

First off, I am not suggesting there is anything wrong with using Ozempic, I know it definitely helps with diabetes, and the success stories are undeniable.

2nd, I have a condition that causes my body to retain water (this is being handled by the proper specialist). This condition makes it hard to gauge my figure because pants I put on in the morning don't always fit later in the day, and if I have a day where I have too much sodium, I look bigger immediately and sometimes the next day. 

That being said, I'm seeing a lot of lifestyle changes regarding food and fitness habits (which is a good thing). I've also been seeing that Ozempic helps with making these changes (more energy, less food noise and cravings, etc.) I'm wondering how much of your weight loss is ""from Ozempic"" or what exactly Oz is doing for you?

I am so glad for this community! For each doctors advice or prescription I need to pay a visit for 70€ (plus the medication itself), so I have got some questions:
I just started Ozempic one week ago. So I got three more weeks of 0.25. My doctor gave me a two in one description for 0.5 right away, so after four weeks I have to level up. Is that a good idea or did you stay longer on 0.25? Also I am on vacation in September, do you think 0.5 has lot's of side effects so it would be better to start after the vacation? With 0.25 the first week went well, regarding the side effects. But I got hunger and food noise a bit at the end of the week (it was still controllable though).

I've asked this question over there, but haven't really got any relevant responses. I'm type 2 and have done low carb and keto in the past, definitely ADD, and have an ED of over-restriction on food if it doesn't fit my minds nutritional parameters of whatever ""eating style"" I'm currently on. I have two kids (8 and 3) and kind have ignored hunger cues for the last 8 or so years to the point where I became naturally OMAD, and wait to eat until after I get them in bed at night. I am seriously struggling to eat enough daily because the meds have reduced my hunger cues even more, and when I do get hungry for food at 10pm, I obviously can't eat that much in one sitting. I am attempting to prioritize protein, which is hard in a way because I don't eat eggs, fish or seafood (combo of just not liking them and allergies). 

My question is if any of you have any experience trying to combat the mental ED restrictions and how you do it. 
Plus what you do if you are OMAD and don't get multiple hunger cues throughout the day because you trained your body that way, how and what are you doing to make sure you hit your requirements without trying to force it all in during your eating window.
And ideas for what to eat to get the required nutrition. I'm honestly having a huge problem with this and some days are as low as 250 calories with protein anywhere from 40-80. Thanks for any help!

The scale finally started to move again three days ago, and I've lost 8lbs in that time. I asked my doctor about it at my check-in today, and she was ver unconcerned.

1f5sob7,reddit,r/Ozempic,"Down 65 pounds. 
Hey everyone, I wanted to share an update on my weight loss journey with Ozempic. I’ve been on this medication for about 2 years now. Initially, my doctor put me on a low dosage because I was prediabetic. I started seeing some progress and eventually moved up to 1 mg, which helped me shed 25 pounds. It was a great start, and I was feeling pretty good.

About a year in, I convinced my new doctor to increase my dosage to 2 mg, and that’s when I really saw a change. I lost another 35 pounds in just two months! Going from 340 pounds down to 270 felt like a huge victory, but then I hit a wall. The weight loss stopped, and no matter what I did, I couldn’t seem to lose more. On the flip side, I haven’t gained any back while on the medication, so there’s that silver lining.

I’ve tried getting off Ozempic a few times, but each time, I would quickly regain 10 to 15 pounds in just a month. It’s been frustrating, to say the least. Recently, I decided to try 2.4 mg, but that’s meant having to pay about $900 a month out of pocket since my insurance only covers one pen. The cost is steep, but I’m determined to keep pushing forward.

I know many of you have been through similar experiences with weight loss plateaus or struggles with maintaining progress after stopping medication. I’m curious to hear how others have handled this. Have any of you tried combining Ozempic with other strategies, like new exercise routines or dietary changes? How did it work for you?

This journey has had its ups and downs, but I’m committed to continuing, and I appreciate any advice or support from this community. Thanks for listening!",2024-08-31,563,25,Ozempic

I recently saw my doctor for loads of what seems like hormonal issues, such as insomnia, anxiety and seemingly uncontrollable weight gain, Although I’m only 36, they believe it’s perimenopause. It’s incredibly depressing since about 6-7 years ago I lost a significant amount of weight all by myself. Literally ate clean, counted calories and worked out. There was nothing else to it. It was hard in the beginning and then came naturally after a while. I was so proud of myself, and now to just keep gaining weight, can’t sleep, just absolutely miserable.

My doctor randomly suggested at the appointment that I be put on Ozempic or something similar and then suddenly back tracked while he was looking at my chart to saying that I can’t because I had a small bowel obstruction a couple of years ago. His reasoning is that that it might help me lose weight, kick this anxiety and depression and rewire what might be going on. I’m not a fan of this but I’m desperate for relief at this rate. Everything seems like a snowball effect and I can’t stand to look in the mirror these days. If I work out too hard, I can’t sleep, if I eat too much I gain weight. If I don’t eat enough, I can’t sleep. It’s like I have no control over my body.

1f5isth,reddit,r/Ozempic,"Magic Pill is about… Well, Hari.. The book discusses mental health and the complexities surrounding it, arguing against the oversimplification of using medication as a catch-all solution. My criticism of the book are concerns about its reliance on anecdotal evidence, potential oversimplification of complex issues and controversial claims about the pharmaceutical industry and the nature of mental health disorders. I feel that it downplays the role of medical interventions in favor of lifestyle changes, which is not feasible for everyone - scientific studies point out that most obesity is maintained by inflammation; not lack of willpower, focus or diet.

It's important to engage with a variety of perspectives when considering the topics raised in the book, as mental health is a multifaceted issue that often requires individualized approaches.

Anecdotal Evidence:
Hari often uses personal stories and anecdotes to support his arguments. While these stories can be compelling, critics argue that they may not represent a broad population's experiences and can lead to oversimplification of complex mental health issues.

Reductionist View on Medication:
The book argues that reliance on pharmaceutical solutions can overshadow other important treatments, such as therapy, social support, or lifestyle changes. While there is merit in advocating for a holistic approach to treatment, some critiques suggest that Hari may downplay the effectiveness of medication for many individuals, especially in severe cases.

Lifestyle Factors:
Hari emphasizes the importance of lifestyle changes—such as diet, exercise, and social connectedness—in managing mental health. Although these factors are indeed significant, the critique lies in potentially presenting them as universally applicable solutions without acknowledging the diverse contexts and challenges that different individuals face.

Pharmaceutical Industry Critique:
Hari is vocal about his criticisms of the pharmaceutical industry because of his own experiences, suggesting that it has a vested interest in promoting medications over other treatments. While it is essential to critically evaluate the role of pharmaceutical companies, some argue that his assertions may border on conspiratorial, lacking nuanced discussion around how medications have historically been beneficial for many people.

Scientific Basis:
Hari's claims lack robust scientific backing. Although he references studies and expert opinions, detractors argue that some interpretations could misrepresent data or lack consensus within the scientific community.

Potential Alarmism:
Some reviewers posit that Hari's writing could be interpreted as alarmist, instilling fear about the over-prescription of medications without sufficiently addressing scenarios where medication is essential for stability and recovery.

Missing Context on Mental Health:
The complex nature of mental health disorders - affected by genetic, environmental, and social factors - means that solutions are rarely one-size-fits-all. Critics assert that Hari’s focus on lifestyle changes might overlook the specific needs of those with chronic or severe mental health conditions.

While ""Magic Pill"" has sparked important conversations about the multifactorial nature of mental health and the need for a more holistic approach, engaging critically with its arguments is vital. It’s always beneficial to consider multiple perspectives when discussing such complex topics to arrive at a more balanced understanding.

As in all Hari’s books it’s mostly about him and his approach to the subject - which can be supplementary. If you delve deeper into his background, you’ll recognize his popular mannerisms are primarily for personal gain and exhibiting his views.

I’m new here, started my Ozempic journey last May where I need to follow a coaching process with dietitian, mental health coach, doctor and group sessions. After a year I can start Ozempic if my IBM is still above 30.
I am a psychologist with a specialized private practice and am embedded in scientific studies and experience. I read Hari’s book, his interviews and was quite alarmed by his populistic approach which I recognized in his earlier books.

 This is a hobby of ours and we got so much good information for our podcast. We also want to help out where we can.

  
WE ARE RESPONDING TO ALL COMMENTS!

Lately, I’ve been hearing a lot of different stories about a certain medication—some of them are pretty surprising. I’m curious to know, what’s the most unexpected or unusual thing you’ve heard about it?

My wife is a doctor, who specializes in obesity, and I recently discussed some of these claims in a video to help clear up any confusion. We focused on addressing common misconceptions and providing accurate information. She see's over 3,000 patients a month on GLP1 therapy. 

We’re thinking about covering more topics like this and would really appreciate hearing what this community thinks. What stories or rumors have caught your attention?

  
Here were last Friday's top 5: (I got permission to share these)

1. Cured my compulsive skin picking

2. ALOT on Inflammation - we did an episode on this already. There are hidden benefits to GLP1 therapy. Dropping this in the comments if you are interested! 

3. I have 0 interest in coffee

4. I took Ozempic and Losing hair

5. I took Ozempic, and became a vegetarian

Thanks for sharing! 

We are open to any suggestions on how we can reach more people. We are filming new episodes and will shout you out if we do your topic!

1f57mrn,reddit,r/Ozempic,"Hello Canadian users:. Where do you get your prescriptions, and what's the maximum dosage they offer?

For context, I am a non-diabetic user and I am using Ozempic to lose weight. I get mine from Felix Health, and they’ve mentioned that their highest available dosage is 2.4 mg. Because of this, they switched me from Ozempic to Wegovy, as Ozempic doesn’t seem to offer higher dosages—at least not in Canada. Even with Wegovy, 2.4 mg is the maximum they provide.

I’m concerned because when I started at 114 kg, I was able to lose weight and reached 96 kg over 5 months. However, for the past 3 months, I’ve been stuck between 96-99 kg, even though I’ve been taking 1.5-1.7 mg doses. Despite being very active and eating healthier, I feel like I’ve hit a plateau. This week, I’m starting my 2.4 mg dosage for 4 weeks, but I’m unsure if it will help me move past this plateau. Since Felix Health doesn’t offer higher dosages, I’m uncertain about my options if 2.4 mg isn’t effective.

Do you have any tips or advice on how to prepare for the possibility that 2.4 mg might not work for me? I’d really appreciate your thoughts—sometimes a fresh perspective can make all the difference.",2024-08-30,1,4,Both

I have been tracking my calories for a couple weeks now and boxing for a couple months. I believe I have PCOS because I have every single symptom and have had multiple ovarian cysts in the past including one that had ruptured. My period cycle has just always been a mess and while birth control helped, it also made me literally batsh*t crazy so I had to stop taking it. I gained 45+ pounds over the last 18 months despite no major changes to what I was eating. I started working out again and eating healthy about 6 months ago and have only managed to lose 8 pounds. I also quit vaping nicotine months ago. Oh, and on top of that. I intermittent fast at least 4 days a week for 16-18 hours. I’m just at a point where I’m so frustrated because I’m doing all the work and it’s going precisely nowhere. Sure, I feel better and I’ve made many great changes to better my lifestyle but it’s pretty difficult to maintain that when you’re not seeing the fruits of your labor. That’s why I decided to give this a try and see if it finally gets me where I want to be. I’m hoping it also helps with the PCOS symptoms. I hate going to the gyno so I try to avoid it and do things that typically help PCOS symptoms at home so that I don’t have any reason to need to go. 

With that being said, I just signed up for WeightCare and had a Groupon for $60 for the first 6 weeks of compounded semaglitude. I plan on continuing to do all the same things I currently do (intermittent fasting, 3-4 workouts a week, eating mindfully) while I’m taking ozempic. 

My SW is 158lbs and I’m 5’3”. When I started working out 6 months ago and making major lifestyle changes, I was at 167lbs but fluctuating between 165-170. My goal is 135lbs and then I plan to bulk up in muscle to 145lbs and maintain that. It’s been impossible to get anywhere near that on my own despite all my efforts and hard work. 

If you have made lifestyle changes in addition to taking semaglitude and started around 160-170lbs, how quick did you lose weight and how did you feel throughout the first 6 weeks? What was the most difficult part?

1f4whdr,reddit,r/Ozempic,"Mentally, emotionally hung up on taste changes. For the most part, Ozempic has been a positive experience. I only just started feeling unpleasant side-effects jumping from .5mg to 1.0mg and those lasted only a day. My body feels better, my mind is clearer, my sleep is better, all good stuff. I don't even think about alcohol anymore and haven't had a drink in weeks. I don't really crave foods, even when I get very stressed out which would normally send me to food for comfort. I have noticed however that my taste for certain foods has changed. Mostly that certain foods which I used to really enjoy just taste kind of bland and I am easily able to stop eating them when full or well before. 

There is a Thai restaurant near where I used to live that has a very special crispy duck dish. It's probably my favorite restaurant dish of all time. My family and I would go there all the time to get that dish, for nearly 20 years this place has been a part of my life. Even when I moved hundreds of miles away, if I ever came back to the area I would go there to get it. My dad passed away a few years ago, and so going to this place and getting that dish has become a more rare event. It also has a connection to those family memories. I get down there maybe once a year or every other year. The food is always so tasty and I relish that dish.

Not that long ago I was down there for business. Leading up to it I was very much thinking about how to plan my travel to get to the restaurant while it was open during it's odd hours and not get stuck in traffic on my 5 hour drive home. I would smile and think about how it would be a nice cap to this kind of stressful business trip. Not obsessed, but it was #2 on my priority list. Eventually I get there, get the food and it's well...meh. From the first bite it was just underwhelming. The smell was great, but the duck itself was flat. I don't know if it was the restaurant or Ozempic, and it will probably be another year or two before I get down there again to retest. I left a big tip and walked out feeling disappointed and deflated. 

Intellectually it seems silly, it's just one meal among many. But this is like going home to mom's cooking after years away from home,and she makes your favorite foods for you, and it tastes like nothing. You remember all the family gatherings you've had in the past where it tasted so good and now? Nope. You're left wondering if there's something wrong with you or if mom has early dementia and forgot to add the salt. Maybe she just had an off day.

I don't know why it bothers me that my taste is so changed, especially when it truly does benefit me in some ways. There are still plenty of foods I like that still taste great, but it does feel like the volume on everything is turned down overall. It makes me think of the [Simpsons Treehouse of Horror where Homer travels to a dimension where life seems perfect, but his family doesn't know what a doughnut is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8DFJBwZchE) (minus the end part). I am not going to dimensional warp away, but it's something I don't think I was ready for and there's an emotional aspect to it. Feeling nausea? Take some tums or something. Food doesn't taste good?

I just finished my first month of being on 1.0mg and I am having a hell of a time keeping my blood sugar levels up! Fasting it is at like 65-60, which aint unusual but I just had an attack of being light headed and (because my VA doctor reported me as diabetic at 6.3% A1C) my health insurance sent me a free glucose meter. Well, I checked it before I was on any meds for diabetes and everything was normal. But, I was told to cut sugar so I did for around a month.

Well, while I was not on any meds, and very little sugar intake, my blood sugar was going really low, like into the 40's and 50's and making me feel just sick.

Well, I ditched my VA doctor and went to a doctor in the community. He told me that 6.3% was not concerning, that yes it could mean pre-diabetes but with other medical problems I was having, I could be getting false positive A1C levels (Inflammation in my ankle (military injury), hip, shoulder (had to have surgery on shoulder).

But what is scaring me is, my blood sugar has been low ever since being on 1.0mg. I am having a hard time keeping it up.

So I brought two pens with me and was able to put them on ice in the car and in the fridges at night in my hotels. I have three more weeks of work travel, but I am now in one place.

I feel just fine at 0.25 and my appetite and food noise are gone, but I’m still eating—just not as much. I just don’t know if I will maintain or lose while traveling and I’ll find out when I return and late October. 

My question is has anyone experienced a huge difference between 0.25 and 0.5 dosing, especially if they didn’t have any major side effects or reactions with the lower dose? I am thinking I will up my dose on Columbus Day weekend when I’ll have three days to recover from any side effects or I might just wait until late October when I get home—and continue at 0.25 until then.

I won’t have blood work done until early November, which will determine if it is working for my type two diabetes but I figure if I continue to lose at 0.25 and have good blood work what would be the reason to increase?

Week 1-2 - Nausea, reduced appetite 
Week 3-4 - I'm so tired I think I'm dying but nausea is gone. A little dizzy
Week 4-6 - Fatigue, dizziness and nausea are gone....now I can eat everything not nailed down and I'm always starving? 🤷‍♀️

1fssc50,reddit,r/Ozempic,"Saxsenda/Ozempic unexpectedly helped chronic GI issues. I've been pondering on this for a while and I wish there was someone I knew of doing a study who I could report my experience to, because honestly it's been so amazingly helpful and life-changing to me I want others to be able to potentially benefit, as well. I've not heard of any studies going on for GERD or IBS sufferers on Ozempic, but here's my story--maybe someone out there will be helped by my experience.

So I've have chronic, severe IBS-D (diagnosed) my whole life. I've also had MALS (restricted blood flow of the main celiac artery) and the accompanying surgery to correct it. It helped some of my symptoms (for example, I went back to being able to sort of digest food sometimes rather than not at all, ever, and losing weight at a rapid rate) but not all of them. I suspect I also might suffer from rapid gut motlilty or stomach dumping, because even though my diet is very good and healthy, I will usually evacuate what I've eaten only a few hours after and then experience intense and wickedly painful stabbing sensations in my stomach that I used to associate with hunger, and won't go away unless I eat something. I have since learned that is not how all people experience hunger. I have a lot of fatigue, heart palpitations, vitamin B deficiency, vitamin D deficiency, and aside from the weight loss I experienced while I had MALS, I've never, ever, EVER been able to lose weight. It doesn't matter what I do in the gym, it doesn't matter how much I eat or how strong I am. My body has never let go of any weight. 

Add to that a pervasive need to always be near a bathroom due to the gastro issues and rapid sudden onset of diarrhea, everything to do with eating has been kind of a traumatic experience for me. If I eat food, I get sick. If I don't eat food, I get sick.

I started Saxsenda (now switched to Ozempic) about two months ago in a last ditch attempt to try and drop some weight after watching it slowly climb upward my entire life. I'm not technically obese, but I'm staring down the barrel of menopause and with my family history of heart disease and stroke, the doctor felt it was a good thing to try to help me drop some of the weight and give me the boost I needed.

I didn't expect it to change almost everything I experienced with food.

I don't have the sharp, stabbing ""hunger"" pains anymore. I don't have immediate urgency to go to the bathroom anymore. I go at a rate and a frequency that feels more normal. I have more normal bowel movements--instead of constant immediate diarrhea, I only have flare-ups maybe twice a week. My heart palpitations have lessened and yesterday I forgot my meds for them and didn't get any at all to remind me to take it. I feel more motivated and less depressed and anxious all the time. I feel like I'm sleeping better. And best of all (to me) I don't feel like I have to constantly worry about whether or not I'll have access to a bathroom if I leave the house. 

I feel like the meds have slowed down my digestion enough that I'm now a semi-normal person rather than a constant ball of food- and toilet- based anxiety, and it is SO amazing. I wouldn't trade this medication for anything.

I was reluctant to try Ozempic because I was really afraid it would make my gi symptoms worse, but it's made many of them so much better. The only side effect I've had that's been mildly annoying is an increase in heartburn, but it's been manageable, and I can mitigate it with gaviscon. I honestly wish I had a doctor or someone I could tell, because I'd love to see and maybe even participate in studies about its therapeutic benefits for hypermotility. 

If anyone out there is like me, maybe consider talking to your doctor about this medication. It's been so great to feel like I can function.",2024-09-30,7,12,Ozempic

i’m feeling pretty frustrated. i’ve been on ozempic since 8.8.2024.

since then i’ve only lost 1.1lb (500g)

for the last 3 weeks my weight has not shifted one way or another. i just had my third shot at 0.5mg yesterday.

what’s even more frustrating is that my mom is on saxenda (liraglutide) and lost 20lb in her first month. i chose ozempic because it’s cheaper and you only have to inject once a week as opposed to every day.

But the only side effect that I have (other than the rare constipation and nausea) would be hunger pains, which are insane and very painful lately. I wake up feeling like my stomach is basically eating itself and it makes me nauseous, to the point that sometimes I can’t move in fear that I’m going to vomit all over myself, and the pain is insane. I’ve never experienced this before and I’m not exaggerating when I say that my level of eating really hasn’t changed much, if at all, since starting. We ordered Chinese for dinner last night (which we ate at about 5:30), I had a second helping around 8:45, went to bed around midnight, slept until 8:30 and woke up to super loud internal growling, my stomach felt like it was eating itself and I was clutching my sheets praying not to vomit from the nausea. Ate a bagel when I eventually got out of bed and was back to normal. 

Now it’s midnight, had a veggie burger and salad for dinner at 6, half of a cucumber around 8, a cheese stick about an hour ago but my stomach, once again, feels like it’s eating itself, growling super loud and I’m nauseous as fuck. Is this normal?",2024-09-30,2,8,Ozempic

So Labor Day weekend and days before I have had stomach pains. I went to the ER and they gave me some medicine for gastritis. Since then I have still been having Ozempic every week, I take my dosage on Sunday. My dieting has ebbed and flowed which I think that’s the Ozempic.

Why I put the side note in is because my mom thinks it could be constipation. I am not necessarily sure that could be the issue.

1fso4sf,reddit,r/Ozempic,"Concerned about birth control on Ozempic . I’ve been on 0.25 mg of Ozempic for about two months. Next week is the day that I’m supposed to increase my dose but I think I’m gonna stay on 0.25 because it is extremely effective. Also, before getting on those epic I didn’t have a period for about five months and it was really concerning me. I’m 27 now, but when I was 19, I got an IUD and I did not have a period for about seven years. Then, about two years ago, I decided to remove my IUD because of hormonal complications, and my period returned shortly after. However, it only returned one time, and for two years after that, I had no period. 
This was one of my concerns, and one of the reasons I decided to go on a Olympic. I read somewhere that it might regulate things like that. Well, to my pleasant surprise, I have had two periods since being on Olympic for two months. I’m not sure if there is a correlation, but I would assume so because this is the only change I’ve made and it’s pretty apparent .
Anyway, I think that the Ozempic has helped me in a lot of ways, however, I don’t think I’m going to increase my dose because I don’t feel I need to. However, I am so delighted to see my hormonal balances begin to fix themselves, a.k.a. me actually getting a menstrual cycle again, and I would really hate to fuck with that. However, I have recently become quite sexually active and I would like to go back on birth control and I would really like to get an IUD again. But I am scared that there may be adverse side effects in relation to my Ozempic shot. Should I refrain from introducing a hormonal form of birth control into my system whilst on Ozempic? And should I wait to get off the Ozempic before introducing this hormonal birth control? Or should I just send it and get the IUD?

Im incredibly thankful that the drug was available with a trusted pharmacist and afterwards with a chain pharmacy at times. If you ever doubt the process, JUST WATCH THIS! I always looked at this subreddit to get motivated since its hard not getting the numbers down as fast as you wish they would. But oh god Ozempic DOES WORK. My hunger is definitely gone, there are some high fat foods I can just no longer tolerate, the anxiety to binge is GONE. I can no longer eat a lot of Doritos because they will make me feel bad. Right now i lost 9kg, standing at 69kg. The goal is to get to 45-52kg (Im 5’1 or 154cm, that’s why it’s a tiny weight). Ozempic is the best thing that ever happened to me. My self esteem is back, I can now fit older clothes and buy 2-3 sizes less than I used to. Everyone notices it and I feel extremely reassured. Tying shoe laces isn’t drowning me anymore, Walking is not as tiring as it used to be, my knees are not hurt when i walk long distances. I go to the gym 2-4 times a week, I have enough strength and energy to do so, and the side effects are completely manageable.

I am not onany other medication‘s at the time. I was going to start a birth control soon, however, I may hold off on that until I can get this figured out with the Ozempic.

Not that Oz does nothing.  I’ve improved habits and can walk away when satisfied.

So…starting Noom recently.  It’s new, and of course tracking helps in the the beginning.  This isn’t so much about their program (it’s no better or worse than any other program that encourages tracking and a healthy zone for a calorie deficit).  It’s about the lightbulb of “I get it” how other people can use these tools successfully without having to go to disordered hyperfocus!

I have been on ozempic for just over two months, and took my 6th dose of 0.5mg last week. Since I started I have lost about 21lbs, and my a1C numbers are finally at goal. I will be increasing to 1mg with tonight being my first dose. I guess I have a few questions for my 1mg people.

1) let's be real, how are everyone's side effects? Side effects definitely hit me and like the works. Nausea, diarrhea, constipation, etc. It usually effects me strongly in the beginning and tapers off as I get accustomed to the dosage. I guess i want to prepare mentally?? 

2) how drastic is the appetite change? My appetite has changed since the start of this medication, which is the purpose. On good days I eat 3 times, a few days twice, and on days closest to injection sometimes only once. (I assume this contributes to constipation) I have to be cautious during these times, if I eat when I'm not hungry or full I can make myself sick. I have accidentally over eaten because my eyes haven't adjusted yet, and yeah not a great feeling. 

3) I know we're supposed to inject roughly the same time and days weekly. Today is my injection day and I normally would do this in the evening. However, I'm on a business trip and will be arriving home later tonight. Due to the timing and nature of the trip, i wont be able to inject at my usual time. Is it alright to delay a few hours? Is it alright to inject only an hour or two before bed? Or better to postpone a whole day and pick up the schedule again the following week?

1ggjx6q,reddit,r/Ozempic,"how best to track calories/macros? . So, tracking food never works for me, because it makes me focus more on food. So calorie counting etc just made the food noise louder, and drove me crazy. Fasting worked better because I could ignore all food while fasting and that was much easier. 

Now I am on OZ after weight gain due to physical limitations for a while, in spite of using aquasize and stationary bike.  Since my knee surgery, I am much more active, but all the activity has increased my appetite and I have not lost weight, and my blood sugars are up, even with metformin.  My blood sugars are much better, with fasting in the low 5 mmol. But I am not losing weight. I am not ""worried"" as I figure it will come. The food noise has also improved. I do get more of that if I get hungry. 

So, I am coming to accept that I will be eating differently on OZ, and that is fine. I normally eat two meals a day (2MAD) but when I was doing IF, I also did lower carb, so the meals were higher in fat. That is not agreeing with me, and I have been increasing protein and carbs a bit with Oz. 

Which do people find better to manage side effects and weight loss? 3-4 smaller meals per day? stay with 2MAD but eat differently?

After struggling with my weigh for the last 15 years, trying everything there is, keto, intermittent fasting, therapy ( a lot of therapy, for the last 3 years and will continue to go because it’s been the best thing) and tired of failing, and tired of being fat and unhappy in this body of mine…. I decided to do my own research on ozempic. I joined this group and some other groups on Facebook.  I wasn’t sure first  because the first time I heard of ozempic was in a celebrity gossip channel and they were just trashing everyone, and the terms “ozempic face” were mentioned several times… so I really thought it was just a fad and quite dangerous.

After researching a lot I realized that’s not the case, and as a woman with endometriosis. PCOS, and insulin resistance, ozempic could be a really good option for me. 
On the last few years I’ve really been in a journey of healing my realism with food, through therapy, I’ve learned to enjoy exercise, I play tenis, I only eat at home because I discovered I don’t like eating out, seem like everything is there for me to loose the weight but it just won’t go away.

So, I did all the blood work necessary previously to the appointment and had my appointment yesterday. 
Where do I start? From the first look he took at me he had this face , almost as a little smirk , I explained to him my medical history, showed him my blood work results… and then he started an endless rant about  how nothing is going to work for me, the amount of times I tried should be an indicator that this is also going to fail.  That the only thing that could work for me is a gastric by pay, because his wife had one, his sister had one and now they are thin and they can eat all the crap they want and won’t gain weight.

At thing point I think I had a really angry face, 😡 because he stoped and wrote a prescription for ozempic and through it at me across the table. And said “I can right you the prescription if you want, but it’s not going to work….

1gg0slf,reddit,r/Ozempic,"Interesting conversation with doctor about Ozempic. I have a new primary care doc - I've only seen him twice now (my former doc left the practice and now works about 30 miles away). He seems okay. 

Today we talked about my Ozempic story. I had to tell him, back in August, that my dose had to be lowered - I was at 1 MG and could barely eat anything some days, plus I threw up on several occasions (for me, that's a very, very rare thing - as in, 3 times in my adult life, so this was significant).  Insurance, or the pharmacy, wouldn't dispense the 0.5 mg pen so I've been using the 1mg, and counting clicks, which saves me a small fortune, so that's cool. 

But what was interesting was the discussion on using it to manage my type 2 diabetes, and weight loss in general. My A1C was 6.8 last fall when I started on it; it went down to 5.4 this past spring. He said ""I wouldn't have a problem if you wanted to stop the Ozempic entirely!"". And he said he tends to be more conservative with doling out the Metformin (oral med for T2DM; standard first line of treatment), not giving it out until you  hit 7.5 or so because diet/exercise should be the first line. Well, yeah, but I noted that I was started on the met when my A1C was 6.4 or so, and I was glad because it might prevent some of the damage caused by T2DM. 

And stopping the Ozempic would be questionable from both a T2DM and weight loss standpoint. My loss has been far outside the norm -  I've gone from about 265 to 172 pounds in 13 months. That might well improve my A1C by itself (though right now I cannot exercise much)... but of course I worry that if I stopped the Ozempic, that weight loss would reverse. 

Anyway, the current plan is to stay on the same dose I'm on (the 0.5 mg, using the 1 mg pen). I should ask if I can try lowering the metformin - it's a pretty benign drug, for me; it MAY be contributing to some gut issues but those developed years after the current dose, so I dunno. 

Finally: I'm STILL losing weight. Honestly, this needs to stop. My ""lifetime supply"" of jeans I bought last spring (seriously - I loved them so much I bought 4 more pairs) is getting too loose. I'm in the ""healthy"" BMI range - if I could afford a tummy tuck / body lift, that would likely remove 10-15 pounds of flappy flab and I'd be even more solidly into that range. Plus, my nutrition status is suboptimal.  If it keeps up, I might consider going to the 0.25 dose. I quipped that I was ""lucky"" to have T2DM - because I'll be on Medicare in the next year or two, and they won't pay for Ozempic for weight loss but they WILL pay for it for T2DM.",2024-10-30,0,2,Ozempic

And he's been supportive in saying he will go to the gym with me,  etc. But i should also note, he used to be a chef, so all of his meals are not calorie friendly, even if they are ""healthy"" lol

Friday was seeing my GP and he just said ""Oh yeah, did you know that your insurance finally started covering Ozempic at the first of the month?"" Giving it a try to see if it helps any. 

Did the first dose Sunday and so far so good. No problems. Don't know if its cause my body is kinda used to it cause of the Trulicity or my body is good with it.

I can tell with my sugars its already helping more and when I cooked hamburgers tonight I only ate one and I was actually full.

Started Ozempic 19/04/24 
Stats as of 25/10/24
Total time since starting ozempic: About 6 months 

Diabetes Type 2
Starting weight: 96kgs / 211 lbs 
Current weight: 74.8kgs / 164 lbs
Total loss : 21.2kgs / 46 lbs
Starting A1C: 6.9 (with Metformin) 
Current A1C:  5.6 

Also started vyvanse for my ADHD about halfway through which compounded the no hunger effect. Realised my eating was dopamine seeking behaviour from my ADHD and autism (life changing info!!)

With that out of the way, I mostly wanted to encourage those of you who feel that the recommended 1mg dose is too high to try going back down to a lower dose, particularly if the side effects are overwhelming. 

For me I spent months with constant nausea, body aches and pains, fatigue, frequent vomiting and had a really hard time eating anything on the 1mg along with my vyvanse. 

Went back to my doctor and dropped back to the .5 and couldn't be happier. Slight nausea after shot day, but the other side effects gone.

I started this medication, not necessarily for a dramatic weight loss, but the food noise I felt everyday (of course there are other factors). 
 
I struggled with binge eating for 20 years. At 6 years old I developed the worst relationship with food and that’s all I knew for years. Well with the help of therapy and this medication, I am not constantly obsessing over food. I no longer think about the next snack, or the next meal, or if I overate, or if I can eat more, or the fact I have consumed thousands of calories in one sitting (on MULTIPLE occasions). 

Well, I had an ice cream sandwich today and only ate half because that’s all I wanted. Like I was satisfied with just that. That’s never happened… even with the gastric sleeve I had some time ago. 

I know it’s no miracle drug and I know there are side effects. I also know this is not a cure for an ED.

The good news is I feel a lot better after only a few days of doing this. Very little nausea and diarrhea, and the sulfur burps are way way down. This can eventually help me identify trigger foods as I reintroduce certain vegetables and such.

They made what seems to be a very strange concept (online doctors are abnormal to me) a super comfortable experience and I'm still using them to this day. My medication was delivered right to my door in a matter of a week from messaging them.

Of course if I wanted to save the $100 that they charge for the initial assessment I would have just gone to my family doctor but like I said, it was a really long wait to get in to see them.

Went to the Dr yesterday when the girl went to give me my shot I verified it was .75 as that's what my normal dose was.  Come to find out the last 3 times before my 2 month break there had been an error and I had been given .25.  Which now I understand is prob the reason for my lack of weight lloss.

Well I wasn't thinking about side effects n got my ""normal"" .75 dose.  This was yesterday at 8am.  Since then I have had vomiting episodes with everything I put in my mouth.  I can't even keep a sip of water down.  I've taken a few different medicines and nothing is qhelping. I have literally thrown up 10 plus times.

However, I have at least two friends that continually remind me “oh wait till you go off of it. Your appetite comes back and you gain it all back “
In addition to that, they seem to feel that it’s necessary to tell me that I’m only taking it for weight loss, which is not true. I have suffered with the misery of the post Covid weight gain for the last three years. I was miserable ,hated myself, stopped exercising, and picked up some bad habits that I won’t go into here. I felt that I needed something to propel me out of my depression, as I did not have the motivation to diet and exercise on my own. A physical exam revealed that my A1c was 8.1 now because of my poor choices, I was diabetic. I was always insulin resistant, so I took a step forward.

I asked my doctor to start me on Ozempic so that I could become healthy again, and yes, that healthy included losing weight and I needed something to jumpstart me as well as control the insulin issues. 

I’m sure right now. I’m telling a lot of people’s story. I actually had a fight at Thanksgiving dinner last night with a female friend yelling at me that I was only taking it to lose weight. Well, I lost it on her and a lot of F words came out of my mouth as I told her to shut the F up lol I also told her she was just jealous because she insisted upon doing it the hard way and then she said well you wouldn’t do it the hard way.

Is there some reason why we need to do something the hard way when it doesn’t work for us oh and another argument that I had with her was she told me they’re gonna take me off of it. Like any other health management medication you can stay on this for life . Another argument.

Didn’t end up snacking but I’m worried about mindless eating. I know this was something I struggled with last year as well. 

I’m thinking my best bet is distraction, but the challenge is I’m not working right now (Back to work in 3 weeks), I have no kids, and winters here (in Northern Ontario) so I know I’ll be less likely to distract myself by getting outside. Just looking for things I can do inside to keep me from mindlessly eating when I’m not even hungry.",2024-11-29,4,8,Ozempic

1h2ccjv,reddit,r/Ozempic,"Sharing my experience: Staying on your minimum effective dose to avoid side effects. Been trying ozempic the past 4 months and wanted to share my experience in case anyone else finds it helpful.

When I initially started on 0.25mg, besides instant appetite suppression literally the same day, I also immediately noticed various benefits like more energy, better focus, more stable mood and better sleep. My insomnia disappeared overnight and I was having dreams in my sleep which I realized I hadn't had in year. I would wake up in the morning well rested! I was losing weight and feeling great.

Following the dosage instructions, I titrated up every two weeks. When I went to 0.5mg, I started completely losing appetite to the point I almost wouldn't eat at all. 

I went up to 0.75mg and then 1.0mg. I started feeling terrible anxiety, went into the deepest depression I had experienced in my life and became constantly fatigued to the point I didn't want to do anything at all. I also had nausea and headache. I felt hopeless about life and it felt like nothing mattered in life. I was barely eating and had to force myself to eat. At the time, there were other stressful things going on in my life, so I kept thinking the anxiety, depression and fatigue might have been caused by other factors. 

After about a month of this, I finally put 2 and 2 together and realized that it most likely was the ozempic causing the mental health side effects. I quit immediately and started to slowly recover. There was a gradual improvement every week and after about 6 weeks, I finally felt like my normal self. The fatigue, depression and anxiety all disappeared.

This whole experience totally freaked me out and for a while I felt like I would never take this drug again. However, I remembered how in the initial few weeks it had a ton of positive effects on me, and how the side effects only appeared when I went up with my dose. So I decided to give it another go, but only stay at 0.25mg. I've been on 0.25mg for the past 4 weeks and so far have had almost no side effects. Only some fatigue in the first two weeks that went away. I am losing weight and feeling the other benefits like improved energy, focus, mood and sleep, which I am super happy about. Compared to 4 months ago, my liver function tests also improved and my early stage NAFLD appears to be reversing.

Reflecting on my whole experience, I am guessing I might be a super responder. It's been a total rollercoaster going through a horrible depression, but now am hopeful that by staying on 0.25mg I can keep making progress without the side effects.

Bad stomach ache. Wednesday was mild-moderate nausea, again, it was pretty tolerable. But then today… Oh my lanta. Today was an awful day. I didn’t spend it with family, I spent it on the toilet with a dish pan next to me for vomiting. Vomited four times and basically peed out of my butt at the same time I was vomiting.

I have made big diet and lifestyle changes since starting Ozempic back in mid-October. Before it I would eat out almost every night from Taco Bell or McDonalds. I would sometimes eat leftovers that my mom and gma made from that night, but a lot of the time I would go out and eat big amounts of food loaded with fats and carbohydrates, and drink soda that was high in sugar.

Hey!

So I was recently prescribed ozempic to help combat high A1C brought on by progesterone meds. The doctor is hoping that by losing weight, my ovulation will return naturally. If that happens my hyperplasia will go away and I won't need the progesterone that causes my sugar to hike up 100+ points. 

The only thing though is I'm not a big eater. I maybe consume around 1500 calories a day at the very most. I track calories based on gram weight so I know exactly how much I'm consuming. Does ozempic help you lose weight even if you don't have much of an appetite to begin with?

I am 25F, SW: 188, CW: 169, GW: 145. I am on my 4th week of 1mg dosage. I handled .5mg well and I felt the most effect, with pretty minimal / manageable side effects. Food noise was gone and I definitely only had appetite for lighter things. Since starting the 1mg, I have noticed more cravings have come back. I struggle with binge eating, which Semaglutide has basically all but eliminated, and has been excellent. However I feel as though some of the cravings seem to be sneaking back. 

Throughout a day, I will have very strong waves that alternate from nausea - enough to drink some ginger ale, sit down, find colder air, use the restroom if possible - to then what feels like hunger and craving, combined. It is usually for something heavy in particular - think Mexican food, or creamy pasta. Of course I am not “giving in” to these cravings, if nothing else because I am at work and cannot interrupt my day to find said craved food. But to me I am unsure if this is a form of food noise that is coming back. 

The cravings / hunger to nausea will go back and fourth many a time throughout the day, and do not go away with eating. On the occasion that I can get the “craved” food for dinner, I am full very quickly as expected, so I am not binging. However i am allowing myself to listen to my body with the craving to a degree. I am thinking this could truly be hunger? Or misplaced hunger in the form of not eating enough protein. Often though, once I eat the food, i swing back to nauseous. 

Has anybody else had this? Am i overthinking normal nausea pangs? I’d love to know if anyone else had a sudden resurgence of cravings for salty / heavy / greasy food in particular, or if anybody has had any drastic changes in experience from .5 to 1. I am considering asking my doctor if I should go back to the .5mg dose instead since it seemed to be fine. 

Thank you so much in advance!!

1aftlng,reddit,r/Semaglutide,"End of 5 weeks - 7 more to go? High Pancreatic levels?. Days on Semaglutide: 35

Age: 41 (M) 

Height 5'9"" / 176.25cm

Starting Weight: 214lb -> Current Weight 196;b -> Goal Weight 170lb. (Highest weight was 225lb)

**Motivation:** Be healthier for my family and myself, move better and get back to a younger weight when I played more sports. 

**Exercise:** I pretty much just play squash 3-4 days a week, 5 times if the schedule permits for 1 hours a day. (ankles can't handle soccer anymore). Against the top players my weight and lack of sustained cardio result in losing tournaments and matches I should be competitive in. 

**Key Diet Changes:** Eliminated a substantial amount of processed foods just from not craving them anymore. Really noticed how much habitual eating I was dong prior to the shot as I would still reach for the snacks the first few weeks even though I was completely satiated. This has helped me start to identify actual hunger versus habitual eating. 

I have also had added clarity to just how large my meal portions were when I would go out to eat with my family, and how even when full, I would habitually keep eating to clean off the plate. I have cut back quite a bit on the frequency of drinking alcohol and went to lighter lagers. 

Typical Morning Meal 6days/week: 2 scrambled eggs, 2 small breakfast sausages, 1 scoop of Spurlina with Juice, 1 Multi vitamin, 1 red yeast rice supplement. 1 12oz coffee with creamer. 

Typical Lunch Meal 5 days/week: Meal prep chicken or beef (6-8oz), 1/2 - 3/4 cup of white rice, 2/3 cup of cooked veggies, 1 slice of cheese. 

Typical Snack: 2-3oz of beef jerky or protein shake

Typical Dinner 5 days/week: 6-8oz of protein, 1 cup of veggies, 1 small starch serving, 

Weekends: Are spent running errands/activities with the kids/hanging out with friends. And usually one evening at the local brewery/pub. 

**Observations:** 

Week 1 - Appetite was very suppressed for the first 3 days and then came back pretty quick. Minimal side effects, minor heart burn on day 2-3, nothing else. 

Week 2-4 -  Appetite suppressed and lasted 4-5 days, noticed real fatigue and lack of energy on the squash court. I had been skipping some lunches at this point and had substantially cut back on my normal intake. Shifted my focus to try and not skip meals and make sure I had some protein at every meal so I wouldn't bonk on the court. Have felt generally a lot more tired in the mornings than normal. 

Week 5 - First week titrating up, felt like I drank rocket fuel or 5 red bulls a few hours after my first shot. Appetite suppression this week lasted throughout the entire 7 day period. Aiming for 1500 calories throughout the week with more on the weekend and focusing on Protein. Added morning pushups as well as dumbbells throughout the day in my office. Heart burn was more prevalent this week as well as some diarrhea but nothing crazy. 

 **Next Steps:** As the weather changes going into spring I would like to add some Zone 2 HR training via light runs as well as some leg strength training and conditioning to improve stability. 

**Blood work:** Pancreatic levels came back elevated so doctor has scheduled me for abdominal ultrasound in 2 weeks and stated she may want to take me off of semaglutide after I complete the 1.0mg 4 week dose. 

This would mean I would still be on it for 7 more weeks at a minimum. I know the weight loss isn't linear however I think following my regimen I could still theoretically get to my goal in 7 weeks without changing to much from what I have outlined above. 

**Thanks:** A big thank you to this community, I have been on here daily reading about others experiences and had never thought about sharing. However in reading everyone else's experience it really highlighted that no 2 journey's are the same, and sharing your overall program and experience may just shed one little tidbit that someone else was looking to relate to!

1afnx8v,reddit,r/Semaglutide,"Advice all-around, please.. I asked my doctor to prescribe Ozempic or Wegovy. He started with Wegovy because my insurance would more than likely cover it over Ozempic, but the starting dose pens are OOS at every pharmacy I’ve called. So he sent an RX for Ozempic on December 24th… which, due to some miscommunication between the doctor’s office and me, I thought they’d checked into it beforehand like they did with the Wegovy (turns out, they did not) and that the Ozempic also wouldn’t need a prior authorization. In the meanwhile, a family member (with diabetes) had 4 unopened, unused pens of Ozempic and they didn’t like the meds. Since I had a script waiting for the exact medication at the same dose I’d been prescribed, and theirs was simply going to go to waste, they gave it to me and I started using it. I’m on the .5 dose, and just about ready to move up to the next higher. Now, in hindsight, this was a terrible decision. This is why you don’t do dumb stuff like I did, so PLEASE don’t “yell” at me. I know I shouldn’t have. However, due to the misunderstanding between my doctor’s office and me, I thought the prior auth the pharmacy said was needed would just be a simple fix. It’s not. Insurance won’t cover Ozempic. It was really working for me, and I was devastated. 
I came clean with my doctor, called pharmacies and found one that DOES have the 1.7 pens in stock. My question: will switching to Wegovy  be an issue? Not only that, it’s a slightly larger increase in dosage. Am I gonna feel like crap over this, physically? I’ve tolerated the medicine very well, with only some occasional minor heartburn. I also only started really noticing weight loss once I moved up to the .5 dose, so I wonder (well, I HOPE, actually) if the higher dose would be okay?

I am only on the lowest dose and I still have low blood sugar episodes - and also low blood pressure from pre-existing POTS. Day after I inject I may be totally fine or I may be curled up in bed, nauseous and without any energy.

Now I am used to the low dose in terms of hunger but the low blood sugar makes me want to eat more snacks during the day, otherwise I start feeling shaky again. So while I’m eating less at meals and trying to have high protein meals, the low blood sugar overrides it and I get something to up my sugar quickly like candy. I don’t have high blood sugar and have a good A1C. Could it be that this med just makes me too low? I’m not diabetic, just have PCOS and stubborn weight from pregnancy and depression.

My PCP is recommending I try GLP-1 for my metabolic syndrome. I think I would like to give it a shot and see how my body responds to it.

Additionally, I think I fulfill the insurance coverage criteria, but you never know what your insurance company is going to decide.

1b3ismb,reddit,r/Semaglutide,"Living a healthy lifestyle, but am obese. Is this for me?.  TL;DR Despite living a very healthy lifestyle, I have gained about 100 pounds in the last few years. Long story short, that is from healing from disordered eating/an eating disorder, and from my active lifestyle getting destroyed by Covid as well as major personal setbacks and life changes. I’ve already lost about 20 pounds on my own. I’m going to ask my doctor about being on this type of medication soon. As someone who does not have food noise, does not have much of an appetite, eats very healthfully, and exercises regularly already, should I consider this medication? 
….

I am currently at 279 pounds, 5’11”,  37, pretty darn healthy, and athletic/active! I got a DEXA (body composition) scan last year and it said have 150 pounds of lean mass (which is a ton, as I still kept up my strength and abilities during my lesser working out era, described below) and I’m actually more in shape again compared to then. They told me at that scan that my ideal body weight would be around 200 pounds and I agree. I feel like I look good at about 220 as well. So my goal weight is around there. I was at this weight a year or so before Covid.

 I can’t decide if I am a perfect candidate for something like this or not a good candidate at all. I do not have food noise  as many of you guys say that you do. I used to have more of that but I really slowly over decades cleaned up my diet to the point where my blood sugar didn’t spike to create any cravings and I do a lot of meditation, so that really helps.

 I eat very healthfully and exercise regularly. In fact, I have exercised regularly for at least 20 years now. I actually have taught fitness and have been doing aerial dance since 2017. Before Covid I was the most consistently active I had ever been … as even though I had been trying to do at least three times a week for a long time mostly successfully, I was actually really doing about 4 to 5 times a week right before Covid. The only time I was not consistent with exercise in the last two decades,
 was during Covid in the first three months or do  of the outbreak. And then during Covid I still took my ass to the gym one or two times a week. After about two years into Covid (delay due to extreme stress and depression related to my CPTSD and things like a new job and moving), I finally got myself doing more exercise again, from one to two times to 2 to 3 times roughly a year ago, now finally back at 3 to 4 times a week for the last four months. and as I have said, before, I do intense exercise at a pretty high level of athleticism, But that decrease in exercise and loss of my aerial dance helped me gain even more weight in those years. Covid shut down my dance studios and I wasn’t able to find a good one or do some of my other dance activities for a long time. I didn’t used to believe in calories, just being healthy and so I didn’t have a Fitbit. Now I have been trying to pay attention to calories and got a Fitbit and I know that I was burning like 1000 cal every time I did aerial dance and that’s why I gained so much weight too when I stopped.

I used to struggle with eating overly healthy, which they are considering calling an eating disorder, orthorexia. Before Covid I read Intuitive eating by  by Evelyn Tribole to help fix that and have had great success fixing all cravings for food and unhealthy eating behaviors that I had with that plan but I did gain probably around 20 or 30 pounds in the healing of that as you’re supposed to let yourself eat what you need to eat.. I had already been practicing mindful eating before that and that had also helped me.  

I’ve done a lot of work on my CPTSD and have done tons of meditation and have done lots of therapy, somatics and dance and trauma focused therapy. I eat organic, high nutrient dense foods, high fiber.  Very healthy lifestyle with lots of stress relief and self-care. And  I have perfect blood work except for thyroid disease, which is well managed with medication. That’s the only medication I’m on. 

I have struggled with my weight since I was a little girl. And for some reason, I’m still feeling guilty about this idea that I could go on this medicine that could really help me. I’m going to the doctor to see if I have sleep apnea because my dentist said I might, and as I look up the symptoms It makes a lot of sense for me because I never wake up refreshed. And that scares me because that’s a serious medical issue related to being overweight. And I already have a And that scares me because that’s a serious medical issue related to being overweight. scary skin issue related to obesity. I do suffer from some depression still . Other than that, thank goodness, I am healthy.

  On the one hand, I feel like it’s cheating, on the other hand, I know I’ve tried my absolute best. Way more than most. I’ve done about every holistic thing on the sun under the sun, and have done. Lots of diets previously gained all the way back. That’s why I was just trying to focus on healthy habits, and have succeeded for the most part. I could still clean up my diet even more again and exercise to the point I was before Covid, and I’m already starting to do all of that. But it really is so overwhelming to think that I have so much weight to lose. 

Do you think someone like me  could benefit from these medicines or should I just try to do it by myself? If I’m honest, I’ve only been on Weight Watchers and I haven’t successfully been able to stick with my calorie deficits on these apps because it honestly just overwhelmed me, especially with where I’ve been the last few years mentally. I’m definitely afraid of the side effects but I’m also exhausted from working my ass off my whole life to be healthy and I could just use a break. i’m afraid of sleep apnea and the skin issue which I can barely spell, and to be honest I think this is a major contributing factor to me being single, and I need to hurry up and have a baby if I’m gonna have one and I wanna make my chances for being attractive to someone high so that it can happen.

1b3fyqm,reddit,r/Semaglutide,"Considering starting semaglutide but worried about side effects after discontinuing. Hi all!

I'm (30F) considering starting semaglutide from Qiral after being referred by a coworker who has had success so far. However, I'm worried about side effects (gastroparesis) even after discontinued use. **Has anyone discontinued after successful results and if so, did you experience side effects even after discontinuing?** 

For background, my current weight is 184lbs with my heaviest being 197lbs (5'-4""). I've been able to lose about 13 lbs in the last \~5 months months just due to working in the middle of nowhere (literally) and not having access to any food options, aka cooking almost every meal at home. In my early 20's I was super into body building and weightlifting and was around 125 lbs with \~15% body fat. Once I got a full time and demanding job, the weight slowly started adding up, especially after COVID lock downs. I've definitely noticed that I seek comfort in food when stressed which is frequent with my job but also struggle find time to work out at the end of the day. My fiance and I are aiming to start trying to conceive starting January 2025 so I know I'll need to taper down and discontinue by October of this year. **This will give me about 8-9 months to taper up, maintain, and taper down before discontinuing. Is this a feasible timeline to go from 184lb to \~140lb given I will be implementing/continuing lifestyle changes as well?** 

&#x200B;

I also know that there are a few indicators for success from what I've read:

* High fiber, low fat diet
* Reduce or eliminate alcohol 
* Maintain/build muscle through strength training in order to have muscle/metabolism for when you discontinue (I know ultimately the lifestyle change is what will maintain results, I think I just need help with getting jumpstarted and feeling lighter because working out feels so uncomfortable at this weight!)
* Tapering back down before discontinuing completely
* Lots of water!

I'm really just worried about negative side effects after discontinuing!

Thanks all in advance!",2024-03-01,2,1,Semaglutide

1b39rwb,reddit,r/Semaglutide,"2 Months Off Sema Update. Hey all! Figured I should do a Post-Sema update, because little is talked about what happens when you go off. 

I’m 33 and 5’7. Started in June 2023 at 166 lbs. my GW was 135 lbs, so that I could “rebound” after the meds and be 140 lbs. This weight is great for me because I am in that perfect middle ground of thin/fit/curvy, and it doesn’t take all the fat out of my face and make me look older. I had to stop at 142 lbs because I was losing my hair. I’m not sure why, but I am guessing I wasn’t getting enough nutrients from the food I was eating. I was a “super responder” and never went above .75 the whole time. 

I’ve been an alcoholic most of my life (childhood trauma) and I LOVED how much the meds made me indifferent to alcohol. My husband and I did not love how it also made me indifferent to sex. So I was nervous to go off of it, hoping my struggles with alcohol wouldn’t come back, but also ready to get back to feeling like my old self mentally. I think Sema made me “satisfied” with everything in my life, which was great, but also not great for other reasons. I missed my Sparkle lol. 

So I went off cold turkey, and have only rebounded with 2.5 lbs! I’m feeling great at 145 lbs. I’ve been working out moderately with Pilates, dance, and horseback riding, and I have been following the 80/20 rule with food and doing great. I notice I started building muscle immediately (which I was struggling with on Sema) and my butt got all juicy again after being pretty flat from the weight loss. I do build muscle and tone very quickly, so there is that, but my body looks great post Sema! 

Mentally I feel awesome. I love pooping first thing in the morning (oh my god I missed that) and my cravings for alcohol have not fully returned. I have made some lifestyle changes that have drastically helped with this as well (getting married and dedicating my life to working with rescue horses). When I get a craving for alcohol, I remind myself that I need to just give it 30 minutes, and it’s okay to tell myself No, and it passes. Food has been a little harder, but since I have been active and eating well most of the time, a bagel or latte every few days is not going to kill me. Libido has definitely rebounded, and feeling great in my body has definitely helped too! 

I’m still watching what I eat, but not obsessing. We try not to keep junk food in the house, I’ve been learning to cook little things that are healthy, and I still eat a piece of delicious sourdough bread with my eggs in the morning to satisfy my daily bread tax, which usually helps me say No to carbs for the rest of the day. 

Mostly I am thankful for the meds showing me that a lot of the problems I struggled with in life were biological and not just “all in my head”. During my time on Sema my husband lost his job and it was very stressful on both of us, but I never once retreated into alcohol, and dealt with my feelings completely sober. I’m grateful that Sema showed me what my life could look and feel like without addiction crippling me, and I have been motivated to maintain that ever since!",2024-02-29,130,13,GLP-1

1b2nyvb,reddit,r/Semaglutide,"Has anyone switched to Zepbound?. I’m losing weight so so slowly on Semaglutide. The food noise is better and I’m not binging but I have only lost ten pounds since November (it’s been a month since I’m on the highest dose). I have been eating right the last six weeks and watching calories but it’s still extremely slow. 

The doctor said it was slower than other patients and suggested Zepbound. She said it’s more effective. I called my pharmacy and the price tag is $1,250/month. I can dip into savings and do it for a few months. 

My question is if anyone did the switch how was it? Did you see an increase? My Sema script is 1/3 the cost of Zepbound  so it feels painful to switch but if it works maybe I bite the bullet.

In my shoes where it’s coming off just super super super slow, would you switch or stick with Sema?

Basically- I was on sema at 10 units from Nov-Jan, as instructed by my provider, I went up to 20 units.

This caused severed gastroparesis symptoms landing me in the hospital. I got my gallbladder removed in 2022 as a note as well.

I stopped taking it immediately (Jan 9th was the last date of my injection) and since then I’ve had life altering flare ups. I basically have it randomly then for the following week my whole body is out of commission. 

Gnawing upper stomach pain radiating into my sternum, loose fatty stools, small aches and pains radiating throughout my body, heart palpitations, sweating, nausea. As the days go on, it slowly gets better but I can’t really pin point what’s triggering it.

I'm now on 1ml/mg. 
I'm seeing my specialist next week to adjust my dose as I've been on prednisolone for months and my glucose is rising again (causing mild hypos) but I'm wondering if an increase might help with weight loss.
Even if it doesn't I still have to increase it but it would be great if it did help.

1bssxkf,reddit,r/Semaglutide,"How to Find a Good Provider (and stay out of the ER). I have read several awful experiences of people across Reddit who went to the ER because of incorrect GLP1 dosing by their doctor, or had other major complications with gallbladders and such. Stories that sounded like they might have been avoidable, at least in some cases, if the person was seeing a more experienced doctor.

Someone asked me how to find a good prescriber. As someone who has taken GLP1s continuously for nearly 11 years with my super badass endocrinologist, with no adverse effects and barely any side effects, that is expertise I can share. So here goes. 

The landscape right now is most primary care, Gyns and OBs do not have the expertise in GLP1s to be managing them. Of course there are exceptions. But generally, it will be several years before your typical primary care doc really knows how to manage them. They just haven't had enough run time because most ony started prescribing in the last 2 years or so.

The providers who are most likely to have the knowledge and experience are:  1) Doctors boarded in Obesity medicine (could be any kind of doctor who has gotten this additional credential; see the doctor lookup below) 2) Endocrinologists, and 3) Bariatricians who aren't 100% surgery focused and have been prescribing for some years. Those are your best bets for doctors who know what they are doing.
 
I personally think your best bet is to find a well recommended, local doctor on your health plan that fits these profiles. I think you get better care versus with an unknown telehealth provider at a for-profit company. If you go with a telehealth provider, it's even more critical that you be educated on GLP1s and ask tough questions (more on that below).

Beforw you see anyone, educate yourself on how GLP1s are managed. 

When you make an appt, you can screen potential providers by aaking, does this provider regularly prescribe and manage patients taking GLP1s? How many approximately? If they say no, or give a low number, don't go with them. 

When you see the doctor, interview them about their experience level. How long have they been prescribing them? How do they handle side effects, etc.? What dose do you start people at and how do you decide when to move up a dose?  How often do you see patients on GLP1s to monitor them? How do they feel about someone being on it for life?

You want someone that wants to see you probably monthly in the beginning, then every few months when you're stable and doing well. You want them to at least be open to lifelong use, because some people need that, but not all do.

If you have done your homework, you should be able to figure out in one visit, i.e., one copay, if they know what they are doing. You should know what the starting doses are for the different drugs so you can tell if they give you the right answer. You should know the dosing instructions and dosing schedule for them. Know the side effects and ask them to tell you about them and note if they leave any out. Basically, do your research so you can be confident in their knowledge and experience.

Honestly, it is the wild west out there right now in terms of providers, and it will be a few years before it settles. So protect yourself!

Firstly, the medication needs time to fully build up in your system (slowly increasing dosage is the only way to safely do this).

1bspr9a,reddit,r/Semaglutide,"3 weeks in . Hi! I’m a semaglutide newbie. I’m on 0.25 each week and have a few questions. 

1) When did you start noticing weight loss/inches coming off? Right now, the only thing I notice is the gosh awful heartburn and the huge decrease in appetite (which I know is the point but this leads to my 2nd question..)

2) There are days where I can only stomach one full meal (and by full, I mean 1/2 of an actual meal). And I don’t snack. I know that this is NOT how I should be doing things and I need to be eating more but it makes the heartburn so much worse. Any tips? I’ve tried every OTC heart burn med, drink only water, stay upright right after eating… 

3) I have a ton of food allergies including dairy, oats and peanuts. Which most protein snacks or Pinterest protein snack recipes call for. Do any of y’all have some good suggestions for HEALTHY, quick, easy protein?

I’ll admit taking measurements is a struggle and maybe I stink at taking them, I don’t know.

Due to my weight and being prediabetic, I was prescribed this and am getting it soon (have to schedule the appointment to go pick it up in person so they show me how to inject it properly) and I was concerned about withdrawal or any nausea/throwing up due to it. I can go days without drinking and have no withdrawals, but I still worry bc I haven't done it in a while. is it possible to still drink, even if it's a small amount? are you able to still get drunk? is the taste of alcohol something you don't even want anymore?

1bsgag5,reddit,r/Semaglutide,"Newbie Advice- What helped me in the first weeks. . Background: Short (5’0) woman (32yr), very fit but haven’t been able to exceed 8lbs of weightloss on my own in the past few years. History of diabetes in my family and I’m insulin resistant. I have 15-20lbs to my ideal weight. This may not seem like a lot but I’m very short so it’s actually a huge difference on my frame. 

Preventing side effects:

1.) 30 min prior to injection I take pepto bismal (advice I found on Reddit) because I’m prone to nausea- didn’t have any nausea or issues post injection. 

2.) Take a fiber supplement- I take psyllium husk following the directions on the back with a meal 2-3x per day. 

3.) Take a magnesium citrate supplement. I take “Trace” gummies. 

4.) If you’re going to do something like go in car ride and you’re already prone to car sickness- take a nausea medicine for car sickness prior. 

5.) Keep an herbal laxative around incase you do experience constipation- if you’re already taking fiber and magnesium a gentle laxative will likely be effective enough.

6.) WATER with ELECTROLYTES. I do flavorless electrolytes by the brand “Eidon.” Force yourself to drink two full glasses of water right when you wake up after brushing your teeth — you want to get AHEAD of dehydration to PREVENT headaches and dry mouth- don’t wait until you have symptoms to hydrate. 

7.) Dry mouth was my primary side affect for that there is a mouth wash called “therabreath” that’s really helpful and lozenges called “biotene” 

8.) I go to hot yoga so and was very scared side effects might kick in- they didn’t but I brought an ice pack in a towel and kept it at the corner of my Matt to hold to my face when I felt like I was overheating and that really helped.

9.) For fatigue, a flavorless glutamine powder in my water has helped tremendously. 

10.) When injecting, the videos may show the demonstrator tapping the needle to remove air bubbles-don’t do that. Instead, draw the needle past your dose (if there’s an air bubble) and then push the needle back to your dose line as many times as needed until the bubble is gone. 

11.) DON’T BE ANXIOUS. It’s going to be okay! There are a lot of people posting about negative side affects but there are plenty of people with none and you’re more likely to be one of those. Especially if you hydrate and eat healthy the day before and day of injection.

1brynpo,reddit,r/Semaglutide,"Points learned on sgt. Ok I have taken semaglutide for over a year and this is what I’ve learned: this is my life. Not that’s it’s the right or wrong way. 
I have not changed what I eat, just the amount. I’ve tried to stick with the Mediterranean diet, but I was not consistent. So I still eat like shit but less of it. 

I’ve lost 36lbs in one year. My practitioner said this is good. A slow loss is a better loss because you won’t gain it all back as fast.. my starting weight was 189 and now I am down 36lbs. 

My hair is SO thin and is half the volume it used to be. I went to dermatologist, I went to pcp, went to gyno, got labs and the sad fact is it’s because of the semaglutide. My caloric intake is not great and I really have struggled with this fact. Like it looks like I have the hair of a 4yo. My practitioner said this is happening to her as well. She is taking supplements and protein powder. I want to cry every time I look at my tiny ponytail. 

I’ve had my gallbladder out. I was 6 months into semaglutide and ended up having a gall attack. When they found out I was on semaglutide they delayed my surgery. It’s about stomach emptying. Ok surgery scheduled. Off 7 days per office.  Now surgeon office said I had to be off for 2 weeks. Well no one told me 2 weeks they said 7 days. The anesthesiologist wanted me off 2 weeks due to gastroparesis. Then while waiting the 14 days I had another horrific gall attack and took ambulance to hospital. So I didn’t want to lie so I could die I said I took it 7 days ago. I was scheduled for surgery that day emergent. They put an NG TUBE down me so they could operate and not risk aspiration. I was pissed! If you know medical then you know this is the Worst ! But I was in so much pain I didn’t care. Now, I know this was for my own safety. But it wasn’t fun. For weight loss. My husband was pissed and told everybody he could I was on semaglutide and this held me up for surgery. I was embarrassed because I needed emergent surgery and because I wanted to lose weight, I was in a pain and freaking a ng tube

Made it out of surgery but stopped taking the glutide. Got scared I would gain weight back so started on it again after I recovered. I asked surgeon if me taking the glutide was the reason for the gallbladder removal and she said no. 

So now I take glutide and I think I will stay on low dose for awhile. I don’t  want to lose too much weight. Saggy neck is a thing also. I see it in my practitioner and me. If you are over 40, don’t lose too much weight. 

This is my first post so I just wanted you all to know my points. Best is lost weight, people praise. Who cares! hair loss and surgery suck! Maybe you don’t care. My biggest thing is I miss my hair! I am vain obviously or I wouldn’t be on this drug. But I would rather have my hair sometimes then lose weight!
That’s my take. ☮️",2024-03-31,1,1,Semaglutide

2. I already drank a lot of water but really had to step it up. Incorporate liquid IV powder if you don't already.
3. The constipation is real. Crushing the water helps the juices get flowing but for me that's the most noticeable side effect. It's deer marbles. Never had constipation before. I need more fiber or supplements. 
4. I have my calories and macros set so I stay within that for the day. Not sad if I go over my protein. 
5. Ideally try to aim for 3-5 workout days. Only did 3 this week. Going to Orange Theory Fitness. Maybe some dizziness but just getting back into the workout rhythm so unsure if pushing myself is doing it or the drug.

1ch5u3b,reddit,r/Semaglutide,"Got my mother on Semaglutide, I think she's helpless. . To start off I use semaglutide  and it works great for me at 2mg to adhere to my strict diet to maintain my weightloss.   My mother was also trying to lose weight for health reasons and lost 20lbs and plateaud like she had her whole life. 

   Long story short I was able to get my mother on it. So now she's a total of 35lbs down.  And we slowly got her up to 1.5 mg where it started to take a noticeable affect. I cooked her a bunch of meal preps and taught her what to eat and what to avoid etc.  I even showed her how to track calories.  Eat high protein. The whole 9 yards. 

 Lately keeps complaining about sugar cravings due to financial stress.  However..

 when I put her on my diet she said she was allways stuffed and couldn't even eat it all and was losing weight.  The next time I check up on her she says she's not losing weight again.. And gives vauge numbers of calories she's eating. Like 500 calories.  But then Says she had pizza hut to ""celebrate"" or as a treat...
  For example She's eating high sugar things like prunes to help loosen up her constipation.  And I told her. Why eat prunes when you can drink psyllium husk fiber that will do a much better job of giving you bowel movements and you'll save the calories. But It goes in one ear and out the other. And it's frustrating because I've tried sending her videos to watch to help her learn and understand all this but she's too damn lazy to even watch a video. Even though she sits on a couch all day everyday surfing the internet reading tru-crime articles.. that's my frustration .

I know i can bump her up from 1.5mg to 2mg. And she will lose more Weight.  But eventually she will plateau with that.  

I guess I'm trying to get her to approach weight loss from every angle along side of the semaglutide.  Instead I feel as though she's letting semaglutide do all the work. And that isn't really a long term solution.  Because even with me I've been on semaglutide for like 2 years now and I barely feel a thing. I used to not want to eat ANYTHING on it.  Now I have to watch what I eat and even then I can still get bingey behavior. But that's where discipline comes in.

Which unfortunately I don't think she's really growing in the discipline department. If she would just walk for 20 minutes a day it would be enough to get the scale moving again. But she just won't.  She says she'll ""do it tomorrow"" or ""when it's warmer out"" then when it gets warm she'll complain it's too hot. 

 I also think maybe she hadn't lost enough weight to feel any different to reall Spark her excitement. Which intotally understand.  So  maybe I should bump her up to 2mgs and get her over the hump she needs for her to finally get motivated.  For reference she's 5'2 and currently at 183lbs she used to be 220ish.

I told her to take progress pictures.  But of course she's too lazy and won't do it. And I explained that you won't really feel different since it's gradual especially at the rate she loses Weight since she dosnt move ever. 

I feel like she works. Against me despite my absolute best interest. 

And to top it all off my sister has been on the same journey and lost like 70lbs in a couple months and is ALL IN.  I'm telling my sister to ease off the gas a little bit 😂   so now my mother is comparing herself to my sisters progress yet my sister is killing it at the gym. Eating practically nothing. Working her ass off.  

And I tell my mom you're not really trying... and it's very difficult to say all this without hurting feelings. So now I'm banging my head against the wall. I wish I had never even mentioned it to her I'm so frustrated investing my time and energy into her. And I love her. She's my mother but wtf... 

Anyways sorry for the long rant. I'm sure I sound like an asshole I just had to let out my frustration and maybe get some input on what to do.  

Do I keep her at 1.5mg? Or will 2mg be the light switch effect.
  Or do I keep firm on my stance of try harder with moving around and burning calories before I give her a bigger crutch .",2024-04-30,0,17,Semaglutide

The doctor started me at 5 units for the first 4 weeks, then 10 for the next 4, and now i’m on 20 units and have been for the last month. This week will be my 5th week at 20 units. 
I guess i’m feeling a little confused and discouraged because when I was done with 10 units, I had literally lost 0 lbs and noticed no changes.  I was really disappointed because I’ve been hearing so many people say they lost a significant amount since the day they started the starter dose, but i figured it was too early to tell and quit until I was on the full dose. Before I started, I would work out at least 3 days a week (lifting and cardio) and have continued that since started. I’ve upped my protein and have overall been eating less. I also have been drinking a ton of water. I still have cravings and periods where I feel really hungry, but then I can’t eat as much as I think (which is good I guess). Other than that, I’ve had minimal side effects other than the fact that my acid reflux has gotten worse.
As of right now, I’ve only lost 5 lbs. And honestly I kinda attribute that mostly to me working hard in the gym and eating better. I need help deciding what to do. Do I need to increase my dose?

1cgcda0,reddit,r/Semaglutide,"Falling into an eating disorder . Hi everyone, I started semaglutide about 3 weeks ago. I am F33, CW 260, GW 250. (I am setting 10 lbs goals for myself, so I don’t get too overwhelmed and give up.) I have not lost any weight yet, and feeling a bit discouraged. I’ve been reading posts in this community, and really appreciate all of the insights and success stories.

I am afraid I am going to reverse any healthy goals and fall back into an eating disorder. I’ve struggled with both binge eating and anorexia. Anytime I stepped on the scale the past 3 weeks, my weight has stayed the same or gone up. I can’t help but think I am doing it all wrong and need to cut back even more calories. I have been eating much less as I haven’t been hungry. Mostly I have been doing 2-3 protein meal replacement shakes per day, or 2 protein shakes and a simple dinner. The only success I’ve ever had with weight loss is eating a very low calorie protein diet, about 800-900 calories, and I lost 40 pounds. 

I’m afraid that when my dose of semaglutide increases, it will make me even less hungry and my mind will trick itself into eating very little, and I will fall back into an eating disorder. I’m afraid that I will starve myself even more as a punishment, if I don’t see any change in the scale or in measurements. 

Has anyone else struggled with these thoughts? I was once emaciated and I think my body remembers and is fighting me. I have been at this same weight for about 4 years now. If I gain a little or lose a little, my body adjusts itself to always want to return to this weight, 260.

I started my journey August of 2023 on Ozempic. I was originally prescribed by my endocrinologist who diagnosed me with Hashimoto’s, insulin resistance, and pre-diabetes. I started on 0.25mg and up to 0.5mg. From August to around November-December, I had lost about 25ish pounds. I was happy with that considering I was on the lowest doses. Plus all my levels were improving so MAJOR positive! 

After follow-up bloodwork, my doctor put in a prescription for the next dose (1mg). However, it was denied by my insurance. The only alternative that I was able to afford was Qsymia (a phentermine/topiramate combination daily medication used to treat obesity). While that worked for a while (I lose about another 5-10 pounds through February/March of this year), I just didn’t like how it made me feel — especially when I worked out. 

Thankfully, I started a new job in January of this year, and I was able to start taking semaglutide. Since I had consistently been on .5mg for months, a physician at work suggested I started there and titrate up every two weeks. However, I’m now at 1.5mg and I have experienced ZERO weight loss. 

I still experience light symptoms — a bit of nausea in the morning and pretty consistent constipation, I’m so frustrated at the lack of results! For reference, I walk daily 4-5 times a week and attend some form of a workout class 2 times a week (mat Pilates, spin class, etc.). While I will admit, my diet is not the greatest, I still always maintain a substantial caloric deficit. 

I just don’t understand what is going on! I thought by now I’d reach my goal as I’m going on month 9 of this drug. And the lack of results is so disheartening. Any suggestions, advice, etc.?",2024-04-29,0,13,Ozempic

Hi everyone — I have been feeling absolutely terrible this week and the symptoms really worsened on Monday afternoon (Memorial Day). 

Symptoms: intense nausea, dizziness, full body cold sweats, rumbling in my stomach, no vomiting but I have spent an unfortunate amount of time on the bathroom floor 

I live alone and have a dog that I couldn’t even take for a walk due to dizziness. My parents are about half an hour away, and I called them several times freaking out, my mom ultimately talked me out of calling an ambulance (no way I could have driven to ER). After 12 hours of misery and no improvement, I called an ambulance around 1am bc I couldn’t handle it anymore. I couldn’t stand/lay/walk/etc. My blood sugar was on the lower end of the “normal” range and the medics suggested I take the zofran I already have and get in with my doctor first thing in the morning. I spent the evening licking my finger and dipping it in a bag of sugar to keep my sugars up. 

I talked directly to my doctor on the phone and she suggested I had a stomach bug or food poisoning. Apparently none of her patients have experienced such severe symptoms and she told me to go back to the smaller dose just in case. It’s now Friday and I’m doing okay but definitely depleted. Barely eating (kinda the point of taking this medication) and feeling like ass.

1d57f8v,reddit,r/Semaglutide,"🥼🧪NEW: Lilly’s Retatrutide for BMI of ≥27.0 + Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease and/or Chronic Kidney Disease ➡️ 5-year trial called TRIUMPH-OUTCOMES . Know anyone with Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease and/or chronic kidney disease who wants to take a GLP-1 medication?

Lilly recently launched has a 5-year-long retatrutide trial trial recruiting 10k participants worldwide. For those who don’t know, trial participants on retatrutide lost [about 24% of their body weight (or ~58lbs) in the phase two trials](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/lillys-next-obesity-drug-just-cut-average-58-pounds-prompting-all-phase-3-blitz). That’s more than any GLP-1 on the market.

> *The Effect of Retatrutide Once Weekly on Cardiovascular Outcomes and Renal Function in Adults Living With Obesity (TRIUMPH-OUTCOMES)* [NCT06383390](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06383390)

BIG THINGS TO KNOW:

- The trial is 5 years long 🙌

- Must be at least age 45 with a BMI of ≥27.0 kilograms per meter squared (kg/m^2)

- Participants may be with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D) unless their hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is 10% or lower

- As best I can tell, the odds of getting retatrutide is 50%

We are a team of medical researchers studying the effects of popular GLP-1 agonists like Semaglutide (Wegovy, Ozempic, Rybelsus) on overactive bladder (OAB). Overactive bladder is a syndrome characterized by urinary urgency (the feeling of not being able to make it to the bathroom fast enough) with or without urge incontinence (urine leakage). People with OAB usually also have increased urination frequency, which may occur at night.  


We're seeking participants for a survey to explore the role of GLP-1 agonists in treating Overactive Bladder (OAB). This anonymous survey takes just 5 minutes. Your input will assist medical researchers in shaping future studies and potentially improving treatment options. Join us in advancing OAB research!

Neither you nor any of the decades worth of professional athletes you have trained have ever dieted to lose weight.

In fact, your only personal experience with eating anything other than ""whatever you want"" is in forcing yourself to eat more because you aren't getting enough calories.

What was going through your head when you went from ""wow, you've lost so much weight since I saw you last"" to telling me I shouldn't choose to have protein shakes in favor of ""real food"" (which I'm also eating, btw) because I'm not an athlete?

Did it occur to you that, on account of a general lack of state sponsored nutritionists in their lives, the average 6 year old learning not to gorge on cake has more experience at portion control than you do? Or did you just randomly decide—now that your fat friend is losing weight—that it's finally open season to criticize her?

This is the first picture I’ve seen of myself in years that I don’t feel like I’m so much bigger than my friends. When I look at this picture, I see 4 people who are built different from each other but no one’s body is inherently better or worse. 

This is a huge mindset shift for me, after a lifetime of pressure to conform to a very narrow standard of what’s ok. 

I just wanted to remind everyone that your success is your success. Where you feel best may not align with a BMI chart or a clothing size. Where your body is healthiest may not be some weight you randomly chose as your “ideal” - because, while losing some weight can improve health, we still don’t all have to fit into a narrow range or be “thin enough”. You’re already enough, no matter your size.",2024-05-31,175,42,GLP-1

I started semaglutide 2.5 months ago. 

Here are my stats:
SW-139 GW-125 CW-133
Please don’t be judgmental on those^

When I started I started strong with 5 units. I was deathly ill. Had to titrate down to 1unit and slowly build to 6units and still had some horrible side effects while my body adjusted. I’ve been slowly increasing my dose by 1unit each week. I’ve definitely been feeling the positive side effects the last 3 weeks on 4,5 and 6 units so I didn’t up my dose this week. Well my hunger is back full swing and I’m gaining weight. I’m worried I somehow didn’t inject the medication correctly because when I injected it, it caused a raised area and blood came out after. Is it possible that I hit a vein or missed my fatty layer and my weekly dose is null and void? Or is this a normal plateau?

However.. I have noticed something else. 
Since taking my first dose nearly three weeks ago, I have little desire to shop.  

This is extremely odd for me, as Ive always been heavily addicted to shopping.  I have always been pretty decent on not caving to the impulse, but it was always there. Always. Sometimes I'd cave and spend, or buy absurd things. 

But now... I am not in the least bit interested in shopping. 
I've opened every shopping app I have just to close it immediately after because I just dont.. care? I don't know how to explain it. 

It's definitely unlike me, but it is a welcome change, whether it's because of Sema or not!

A little background, I lost 60 pounds in my early 20’s, I’m 5’6” and went from 200 to 140 from counting macros and lifting weights. Over 10 years, i fluctuated a little bit, but have always kept the weight off. Fast forward to 2020 (last pic) I decided to get an IUD, and gained 20 pounds within 3 months. My doctor assured me it was not the IUD but over the next 3 years, nothing budged. I finally got it removed last August in hopes that I could regain control over my hormones and get the extra weight off. Then I gained another 10 within a month and was at my highest weight of over 170. 

To be fair; the past year I was really depressed as I had lost a job, I was super stressed planning a wedding, starting a new career, so I wasn’t being super consistent in the gym or counting all my macros. So a couple months ago, I started semaglutide to get me going again, since I started- started counting macros, focusing on protein, lifting weights consistently. And I have nothing to show for it.

1ds7vn9,reddit,r/Semaglutide,"Confused by periods of constant hunger?. 29F SW: 208 CW: 198 5’7”

Sorry in advance for the long post but please help! I am having some really intense periods of constant hunger that I do not understand. Hoping someone out there has experienced something similar and has found the root cause. 

I started on semaglutide April 17th at .25mg and had pretty immediate success for the first four weeks. Noticeable reduction in appetite with basically no side effects and lost 4 pounds within the first couple weeks with basically no effort. I was thrilled and feeling really optimistic about the potential for success on this medication after spending half my life gaining and losing the same 40 pounds more times than I can count. 

That quickly changed when I bumped up to .5mg. Within a couple days after my first injection at the higher dose, I started noticing this nagging hunger that was impossible to get rid of even after eating. I could tell it wasn’t the same as the normal hunger I would feel prior to being on the meds. The best I can explain the sensation is like my stomach is constantly on the verge of feeling like it’s about to growl but just can’t actually get to the point of growling. It’s EXTREMELY annoying. Almost like an empty cramping but not painful. It feels like my stomach thinks I haven’t fed myself all day even within 30 minutes after eating a full meal. I wouldn’t even say that I have an appetite per se, just this nagging empty stomach sensation that I feel like I have to get rid of by eating but can’t. The first week experiencing this I kind of just assumed it was part of the process and kept on the next few weeks with the same .5 dose. Unfortunately the hunger continued daily and the only thing I found that helped subdue it even a little is basically snacking on protein bars and shakes constantly throughout the day. This didn’t fix it but it did help dampen the sensation somewhat. During this period the weight loss completely stopped and it was honestly a miracle that I managed to keep off the few pounds I lost at the start and not regain any given how hungry I was 24/7.

At that point I had a check in with my doc who was baffled by what I was experiencing and suggested skipping over the next titration dose to the one after. So I bumped up to 1.25mg and the hunger miraculously disappeared almost immediately, which was a huge relief. That was at the beginning of June and finally I was feeling even more reduced hunger than I had in the first few weeks and along with daily exercise have been able to get up to 10 lbs lost over the course of the past month. 

Well to my extreme frustration and disappointment, that same nagging hunger has started to creep back in over the last week and I am truly stumped as to why??? Still taking the 1.25mg dose that got rid of the hunger in the first place so I don’t know what’s changed. Maybe diet plays a part but I am definitely not starving myself, focusing on protein and hydration, and not skipping any meals. My diet hasn’t really changed over the course of the different doses either so I don’t know why it would cause hunger on one dose but not another.

Is my body just adjusting to the meds at an extremely faster rate than most? Is it a hormonal thing? I haven’t been able to pin point the hunger to any specific part of my cycle but hormones have always been an issue for me. I am considering asking my doc about tirzepatide instead but would prefer not to have to start at square one again.

I recently started taking Semaglutide and would love to hear about your experiences with it. I took my first dose of 0.2mg two days ago and am starting to feel the effects today.

A bit about me:

* 30-year-old male
* 5'10""
* Weigh 227 lbs

Since starting the treatment, I've been sticking to a healthy 2000 calorie diet, focusing on high protein. My goal is to consume 225g of protein daily (1g per 1 lb of total body weight) and I do weight lifting 3 times a week to maintain muscle mass, as I've heard you can lose a lot while on this treatment.

However, I've encountered a problem. At 2000 calories, where the majority of my intake is protein, I find myself forcing myself to eat and feeling bloated and overly full. It's becoming quite uncomfortable.

Is a 2000 calorie diet appropriate for my situation? Has anyone else experienced this? How do you manage high protein intake while on Semaglutide? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!

My goals were some weight loss and a shot at kicking my sugar habit. I lost 10 pounds but the side effects have been too much for me: lethargy, lack of motivation; a sense that I haven't been myself; and forcing myself to eat even the smallest amounts of food. 

The good stuff: I quit drinking wine every night; I learned a lot about my relationship with food & sugar.  

My husband has always joked that I ""covet"" food. Turns out, he's right.  Sometimes, I want the choice about the sweetie which means having it around EVEN when I have no desire to eat. I think there's a lot of childhood and economic factors involved with the ""coveting"" like being an adult that can make my own decisions about what I eat and being able to go to the grocery store and pick out whatever I want.

1egy5p3,reddit,r/Semaglutide,"Looking for encouragement / advice (sema depression) . SW: 155 HW: 163 CW: 136 Height: 5'0''

Hey all, I started my Sema journey in March using Rybelsus. My loss has been slow and steady, which I am okay with. I work in agriculture and have a very physical job so I've had to be careful with my deficit so that I have the energy to safely work in high heat and humidity.

I started at 3mg for a month, didn't see any loss but was feeling minor effects. Moved up to 7mg as expected and began to lose, it was so exciting! I became overweight as a child and although I have a good understanding of nutrition, exercise regularly, and got my binge eating under control prior to Sema, I've never had success losing weight. I've lost the same 10-15 pounds probably close to a dozen times but have never been able to reach my goal or maintain the loss in the off season.

Things were going well until early June, then depression hit so hard. I've struggled with depression in the past but its primarily situational. I have been in therapy for years and am doing the work necessary to improve my mental health and work through trauma. However, nothing has been able to touch my depression induced by semaglutide. I've done ketamine clinically in the past with tremendous results. I went back for a booster while on sema and it had no affect. My Adderall - no affect. Micro dosing magic mushrooms - no affect. I've since cut my Rybelsus in half; I've gone from one 7mg pill everyday to three 7mg pills a week (mon, wed, fri). I'm maintaining at this dosage but have plateaued, I can't lose more and I'm not at my goal. I haven't been able to lose without medication, so I don't expect to lose now at a maintenance dose. Also, I'm still so miserable, although the depressive episodes are worse on days when I take my pill. I'm so frustrated and frankly, devastated. This seems like a miracle medication for so many people and it seems I won't be able to use this drug in the way I had hoped.

Has anyone had luck combating the complete and utter lack of joy on this medication? I hate to think I need to choose between being in a more comfortable body or being happy. I would like to lose 10-15 more pounds if I can find a way. Desperate for any encouragement or advice y'all might have.",2024-07-31,1,3,Semaglutide

When i say my life has changed for the better, i am genuinely not trying to be cliche lol my health, which was my main priortiy, is substantially better, as is my mental health and overall well-being.

However lol, the past few months have been quite tortureous with serious vomitting and diarrhea, to the point my potassium is dropping and i no longer feel safe at home alone. I found myself wondering what the hell im doing different now as opposed to the last 7 months. Switched clinics, who had to switch pharmacies a couple times. I dont know if the medicine is just stronger or what, but i *did* have a realization. Sunday was injection day (switched to sunday nights so i wasnt sick on the weekends - *to be clear, i am not on branded glp-1). Monday, i woke up fine. Tuesday, was a very different story. I was honestly scared. I did some research and found this GoodRx page, which was when i realized that my food consumption the day prior very well may have caused my illness as my food consumption was most of the stuff on that list - cheeseburger, fries, soda, ice cream sandwich 🤦‍♀️ So all day tuesday, i drank Jocko protein drinks and stuck to a liquid diet and i felt significantly better throughout the day yesterday and today! But now im terrified to eat typical summer foods.

The medicine didn't seem to be working for me the way it does for most people and I was bummed out about it. I started a new dose of Semaglutide from a new pharmacy on July 12th and it has been like a totally different medicine- I've dropped 10 lbs in less than three weeks! Less than a week after starting this new dose I started what seemed to be a second period for the month of July. Two weeks prior I'd finished my cycle, I'd tracked my ovulation, and I ovulated on July 21st. That means that 4 days past ovulation I started bleeding for the second time, which was on July 25th. In fact, I'm still spotting. During the course of this bleeding, it got very heavy and crampy and wasn't like my normal period at all. 

  
Today my left breast was hurting something fierce and I thought, ""I'll take a pregnancy test, although the odds are slim to none that it's even possible I could be pregnant"". Annnnnd it's positive! Faint, but two lines. I took two more tests and all three are faint BFPs. I was and am stunned. Today is 9 dpo (days past ovulation) and that's when I would normally get a positive test (I have other children), and here I am, pregnant, even after all of that bleeding. This has never, ever happened to me. What gets me is that implantation happens as early as day 5, but typically around days 7-9ish past ovulation, which means that I started bleeding BEFORE implantation ever even happened.

This community page has really kept me motivated with their progress pictures and tips/tricks. I have been eating healthily, prioritising protein and fibre. I do occasionally have some treats but I don’t crave it as much anymore. Some people have noticed that their appetite tends to come on full force in some weeks taking their semaglutide and other weeks it feels like it’s doing its job at suppressing appetite.

You might say water weight, but I've been holding steady at 188.5 for months, despite two summer trips with happy vacation eating. Even when i had had several days of poor eating or several days of low cal healthy eating. No movement on the scale.

I'm several years post menopause and my weight's been creeping up 4-5 lbs a year, despite doing all the Right Things(tm).

The weight loss hasn’t been IMMENSE, but I finally feel confident in the clothes I wear and find joy in going out again. I can see the difference now in my confidence and my body. I now have my PCOS and insulin regulated. This medication assisted me in being in control of my life again.

since then i’ve only lost 1.1lb (500g)

for the last 3 weeks my weight has not shifted one way or another. i just had my third shot at 0.5mg yesterday.

i’m feeling really frustrated. i’m eating like a normal person should (i was instructed when i was hospitalized for an eating disorder 7 years ago.)

what’s even more frustrating is that my mom is on saxenda (liraglutide) and lost 20lb in her first month. i chose ozempic because it’s cheaper and you only have to inject once a week as opposed to every day.
 
i’m worried i won’t start losing weight. did anyone else experience this? thanks",2024-09-30,0,23,Ozempic
1fsrb9a,reddit,r/Semaglutide,"Signs of hyperthyroidism in both me and my mother after starting Wegovy. Anyone with the same experience?. Hi, everyone! 
English is not my first language so I want to say sorry in advance if I’m not able to express myself sufficiently. 

I’ve been using wegovy for about nine months now and I’ve lost 63 pounds. I started with 0,25 mg and then slowly increased my dosage up to 2,5 mg. Right now I am on 1 mg due to the cost of the medicine. 

My mother talked to her GP a couple of months ago and was prescribed Wegovy as well. She is now using 1 mg.

I have been getting bloodwork done yearly ever since my mom was diagnosed with Graves’ and had thyroid cancer to monitor my thyroid function. She had surgery done to her thyroid due to cancer. Additionally, she had to have surgery done twice to her eye because of a gland behind her eye was pushing her eyeball causing her to have this typical Graves’ staring eyes. 

Main point: 
After I’ve been using Wegovy for nine months, I had bloodwork done again. This time, for the first time in my life, it showed signs of hyperthyroidism. 

Moreover, after my mother started on Wegovy a couple of months back, the very same eye she had surgery on is starting to bulge out again and she has signs of hyperthyroidism and has been adjusting her medication due to it. 

Are there any of you that has the same experience as us? I’m not sure wether it is due to the Wegovy medication or not, but since we both have the experience at the same time, I am genuinely starting to wonder if it has something to do with it. 

Thank you in advance. 

TLDR; me and my mother showing signs of hyperthyroidism and suspecting it has something to do with Wegovy",2024-09-30,1,8,Wegovy

Lunch... I had exactly the same lunch as exactly a week ago. We went out and had a pumpkin soup with wings. Two starter portions.

1gg1u4l,reddit,r/Semaglutide,"microdosing to reduce anxiety side effects?. Hi everyone,

A little background. I started Ozempic about 1.5 years ago for PCOS. I started on 0.25, then went to 0.375, then went to 0.5, and eventually 0.6-ish. After my third week on 0.6, the panic attacks started. I’ve dealt with anxiety before but NOTHING like this. It was truly debilitating. Ended up starting buspar and I have hydroxyzine as needed. I stopped ozempic and tried reintroducing it at much smaller doses. This past June I was at my target weight, but wanted to continue taking ozempic as a maintenance dose. I injected 0.25 and got very very anxious again the next day, and so since then I’ve stopped taking it altogether out of fear this may happen again. I’ve already gained some weight back and I’m beginning to get stressed about how long I’ll be able to maintain this weight before things start going back to the way they were..

Has anyone had experience microdosing ozempic to avoid anxiety/side effects? I’m thinking about just like a 2-3 clicks per week or something very small just to help my body balance out again.

Has anyone dealt with anxiety from ozempic and found an alternative weight loss med that helped??

Any and all advice appreciated, thanks in advance!",2024-10-31,7,1,Ozempic

Originally, I was aiming for around 185-190, maybe even stopping at 199. But I felt like I still had a ways to go. Then, the other day, my wife kind of surprised me by saying I’ve gotten too skinny! She blurted it out! When I asked what she meant, she clarified that she thinks I’m getting ""too skinny for my build.""

I get it—I’m a bigger guy, large frame, ""big-boned,"" if you will, lol. I’ve been keeping up with protein to avoid muscle loss and started weight training again with some solid cardio. But according to the BMI charts, I could still lose another 20 pounds and be considered “healthy.”

So here’s the dilemma: Do I keep going and aim for what the charts say, or should I listen to my wife’s feedback? I know weight and health are very personal things, but I’m genuinely torn. I want to feel good, look good for both of us, and be healthy in the long run. Should I call it here or push a little further?

I’ve been on ozempic for about 8 months. I mostly dealt with constipation and started taking fiber supplements, which helped. I only had diarrhea if I ate greasy foods. Diarrhea started happening a little more frequently back in September, so I stopped the fiber supplements and it seemed to help for a little while. But the last 2-3 weeks I’ve been having diarrhea consistently. I did have a change in diet- I started eating yogurt again (I hadn’t had it in months). I quit the yogurt about a week ago and I’m no longer having as severe diarrhea and my stools are firming up a bit more but it’s still happening sometimes and I’m noticing mucus- dark brown and light red in color. There is some light red blood when I wipe. Sometimes it’s just mucus coming out, and I feel very sudden urges to go to the bathroom. My stools are mostly normal in color except once or twice this past week it was darker (dark brown, not black). I’m not having any pain.

I’m seeing my PCP on Monday and they already wrote me a referral to a GI doctor, but I’m nervous- could this be something more serious? Are these side effects likely due to the ozempic or something else?

I quit taking the medication but it's been swollen ever since. I've had 2 scans done. The first scan in July showed 6mm nodules on both the right and my left thyroid. Both nodules were classified as a TR2 on the tirads. 3 months later in October they were both 7mm and classified as TR4.

 I was told when starting this medication that  the thyroid cancer was only shown in lab rats but we are finding that it's also being found in humans.

 Please read the package inserts incase this happens to you. The package insert states STOP TAKING THE MEDICATION if you have any throat swelling. I have spoken with other women and men this has happened to.

Some of them were diagnosed with thyroid cancer.  ( yes this may be anecdotal  but thats why we should be reporting every single case that how we find patterns) 

please, I am begging you if this happens or has happened to you please report it to the FDA.

 Many of the people I spoke with did not report the side effects for XYZ reasons... im going to link the med watch and the one study thay did show a link to all types of thyroid cancer. Please know I'm not trying to scare you out of taking the medication. I want you to be aware and I want this side effect to get reported so they can make future changes. If you want to see the numbers of all thyroid cancers reported you can find that information on the FDA website. Only around 1-10% of people who experience a sode effect will ever report it.

Although I've been on it only a week, I am confident phentermine will do that for me. Also, I am aware that this isn't a new drug and comes with some possible side effects. Right now, I'll take whatever helps me see some results! Thanks to my doc and phentermine.

I have been on Sema for 5 weeks and have lost 9 pounds so far. Everything has been going great except the constipation. I am trying to find a good daily regimen and what I’ve done has caused more issues than it has relieved, so I’m curious to see what others have done. I am hesitant to continue to increase the dose since I’ve been rather miserable the last couple of days. 

I’ve been taking mostly daily Miralax and twice have tried Mag07. I take the Miralax in the morning and have taken two Mag07 at night. The Miralax doesn’t seem to keep me regular and the Mag07 is way too strong. It gives me bad painful cramps and bloating, and then bad diarrhea. The first time I took it I threw up after taking the pills so I took two more. I thought the intense reaction was because I must’ve not thrown up the pills I took. But earlier this week I only took two and had the bad reaction again.

Some background - I had colon resection earlier this year to remove 18 inches of colon infected with diverticulitis. As part of my full recovery from that for the rest of my life I am to take psyllium husk fiber powder daily, along with a laxative. I usually take them together with a glass of orange juice, since the fiber is already orange flavored. This was usually my pseudo-breakfast, along with some coffee. Happy to say this has been going well. 

Well. After starting my first dose I had the worst stomach cramps and bloating I’ve ever had. I couldn’t pinpoint it to anything specific, but it was bad. So I eliminated the fiber first, thinking that might have been the trigger. 

And yep. That was it. Haven’t had the stomach cramps or bloating since. But not taking the fiber isn’t an option.

TLDR: 

>Around 85 per cent of people with overweight or obesity who lose at least a tenth of their body weight regain it within a year.  
...researchers sequenced a type of genetic molecule called RNA, which encodes proteins, in fat cells. They found that people with obesity had increased or decreased levels of more than 100 RNA molecules compared with people of a healthy weight, and these differences persisted at two years after weight loss.

Eleven months ago, I posted on here asking for advice on how to lose weight. I was a bit desperate: I had weighted myself on New Year's Eve, while on vacations, something I hadn't done in quite a while, and had found out (yes, found out) I weighted 136.5kg (300lbs). I knew I was fat, overweight, obese, etc., and I had always heard that, but I didn't thought I weighted that much—I knew I had gained continuously some weight due to a persistent depression in the last few years (and in fact, before it, I was just overweight, not grossly so), but in my mind, I still weighted 119kg (262lbs), like in 2021.

Well, on that day, and realising I wasn't that depressed anymore, I decided to try to lose weight. I started counting calories immediately, trying to be less sedentary. After I got back home, I started on Ozempic, which helped quite a bit—before it, it was very hard controlling how many calories I was eating, and all I could do was planning my next meal. I lost 20kg (44lbs) in the first five or six months, but the next ten were much more work—a bit because I wasn't that rigid for a month or two while I was on a plateau. I do confess I am a bit disappointed in myself: I sort of expected to be below 100kg (220lbs) right now, but 106kg (233lbs) is good enough, I guess. I also feel considerably more attractive and confident. But at the same time it is a bit disheartening to realise how even my family now treats me differently, now that I am slightly thinner.

I found a few threads about this topic recently but the last one was 2 weeks old and I'm curious if anyone has some updated information. 

My wife happened to hear that Wegovy was going up in price with BCBS (we have Standard). I had no idea this was occuring. So I called BCBS and was told that, on the standard plan, it would cost me approximately $650 out of pocket in 2025. I also asked about the mail-order price I saw on their website ($125/84 day supply). **They said that mail-order will not be available for Wegovy.** I know there was a previous  thread that said mail-order would be available. I told them that I currently pay $25. They said that I should be paying over $300 and I should call my pharmacy to see how the price is $25.  

So I called my pharmacy. They said they don't have the 2025 pricing and can't get an estimate without new insurance. I asked how the price was getting to $25 so that I could see what the price would be with whatever coupon is that they are using. They said that they aren't applying a coupon so they aren't sure why the price is that low and suggested I call my insurance. When I told them I just called my insurance they suggested I call my agency. 

Anyway - I'm getting the run around. I'll call my agency on Monday but at this point I think I need to find another insurance carrier. Disappointing because I've had BCBS for literally my entire life and have otherwise been happy.

**A few questions:**

- Does anyone have any updated information from BCBS about Wegovy coverage?
- How is my prescription costing $25 without a coupon? 
- What coupons will be available in 2025 and will those coupons cover the cost of Wegovy?

1h2xddu,reddit,r/Semaglutide,"my semaglutide experience at 16-17. okay well let me start this by saying Ive turned 17 about 20 days ago and I'm clearly overweight I have tried many diets and stuff and I'm not gonna be a dumbass and blame it on the diet it's clearly my fault I didint have good consistency and lacked discipline and fell into temptations so I started researching sarms, anabolic steroids and stuff then I came across the beautiful wegovy semaglutide injection and wow how much it has done for me and I'm still on my first pen 💀 

I'm 17 168c-175cm ish 108kg kid well now I'm 103-102kg and Ive been going gym for about 8 months and sometimes I would really slack off and not go for months or weeks and it wasn't good but I had decent genetics good insertions and rapid muscle growth and strength gain. I was originally around 90-95 for a very long time then I slacked for a month or two and jumped up to 107-108kg and it wasn't good I tried starving my self it worked intially but the most stupid thing lost all strength and muscle but gained it back with maintenance diet and training it took me about 2-3 weeks then I went in for my blood test results I take bloods every now and then since it's free ( Australian Medicare) I only do it to check up on everything to make sure I'm healthy I mean it's free why not use it to my advantage I only do it every 3-6months and I was speaking to my doctor who semaglutide and he was warning me about the issues it can cause and side effects and he initially didint recommend it but after I explained my struggles he said it's up to me if I really wanna do it and I said yes and I do not regret it at all wow how amazing this drug is so I got my prescription then got my injection a few days later from the chemist and damn 250$ AUD is a lot for a monthly medication I wish Medicare covered it but it's like the only drug that's not supported by Medicare discounts and the first few days of my injection were absolute hell I got insomnia, nausea, dizzinessz, headaches, heat waves and worse I literally was ready to drop this drug after day 3-5 ish but I held through I would vomit so much on my first few days because my brain was used to eating what it usually does but the semaglutide triggered the glp¹ hoarmoans and caused a slower digestive system so I ate my regular food then half way my stomach is killing and then I go vomit I eat again and vomit and repeat this like 5 times before I realised to stop eating so my stomach can calm down and also to anyone who experiences these symptoms just avoid food for several hours and try drinking hot tea it helps sooth the stomach and relief it of sensitivity 

but yeah my experience has been good so far it was only the Begginng of the drug that was hard and it's really potent for me my next injection is in 2 days (Wednesday) and is my upped dosage of 0.5mg from 0.25 so I'm a bit excited to see how much stronger this will be since it's double and I know it won't be much of a difference since the body adapts to it and builds a tolerance but towards the end of my 0.25 I noticed it wasn't doing much at all and I would get frequently hungry more and more when before I could go 4 days without eating before realising oh shit I need to eat otherwise my body will burn my muscles instead of fat but now I have gone back to gym and I've been on a carnivore diet Ive basically been eating eggs and steak all day and sometimes, mangos, banana and so on but no processed carbs at all since they convert to glycogen

I'm just so confused how people loose 8 pounds (3.4ish kg ) after like 5 months, like what the fuck that's crazy honestly that's not worth it if your gonna loose 8 pounds I remember walking into my doctor's office and telling him I lost 6kg and bro lost his shit and before anyone comes at me saying it's muslcs it's definitely is but not a majority maybe a few 100 grams because my arms and legs and chest have been more lean and defined more then ever and my progression hasn't stopped one bit 

I can't wait to see my results after 5 months or so I'll probably come back here and do a edit about it and if you guys want edits just upvote it I'll do weekly or monthly reports on everything my diet symptoms weight loss and more!",2024-11-29,1,1,Wegovy

1afzsx5,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Restarting after 2 months off. I wanted to post on here since I ate spent a lot of time looking for similar posts prior to restarting and didn’t find much out there. 

I started taking GLP1 about a year ago started on Victoza for about nine months. I pay out-of-pocket so I wasn’t able to ever get to the adequate dosage I needed. The entire time I was on Victoza I only ever felt constipation as a side effect. I was able to lose 20 pounds on the starting dose over those nine months. 

I met with my doctor at the nine month mark and we decided that it didn’t financially make sense to stay on Victoza so I started on Ozempic 0.5mg. That for a month and didn’t have any symptoms. 

I decided to take some time off because I plateaued for a very long time. I’m sure headache stayed on ozempic I would’ve started to see progress. This was during the beginning of November 2023 so there were shortages, and I was not able to find wegovy 1.0. Which is what my doctor and I had to was my next logical step. 

I was off any medication for two months. I took this time to start working out. Luckily none of the weight came back. The second month was pretty tough though because all of my appetite and cravings came back with the vengeance. I felt like I was eating everything and anything I could.  

I stopped by the pharmacy and check to see if they could fill my prescription. Luckily they could and I signed up for the coupon available through the website. 

I suffer from pretty bad anxiety, so I was very stressed out to start again after months off and at a higher dosage. 

here’s a quick recap of the first couple of days. 

I took my 1mg dose of wegovy Saturday night before I went to sleep. I had a Pepcid about an hour before and another as soon as I woke up the next day. On Sunday I woke up and was pretty nauseous, like a hangover. It lasted all day, and I didn’t have much of an appetite. That was the only symptom I had that day. On Monday I woke up with zero nausea, but I felt very weak and I had a really bad headache. I was in bed for most of the day, but towards the end of the day I started to feel better. I’m not sure if it was related to the medicine or if it was just because I didn’t eat much the day before. I had diarrhea that morning, but it was only once. That has been my only bowel movement since taking the medicine. I’m taking the stool softeners, but only one a day. Not sure if I should take more. My appetite is definitely suppressed I feel like I’m eating less than half of what I typically eat.

I recently switched insurances and got my PA for Wegovy approved for the year. My plan doesn’t cover it as much as it did last year, so I’ll have to pay a hefty amount for my first 90 day supply but my deductible will be met after that and I’d assumed my cost will be much less after that for the rest of the year. 

Ive been giving some thought to seeing if I could switch to Mounjaro because I feel like the 2.4 maintenance dose doesn’t work as well as it used to (somewhat increased food noise and not feeling as full for as long) and my best friend has been on Mounjaro for a bit and loves it. Has anyone switched before and can you switch to a higher dose of Mounjaro because you’re already used to the highest dose of Wegovy? Wegovy still works for me, I just can’t coast on autopilot like I used to on the lower doses when I first began and that’s not a bad thing. I’d have to get a PA approved for Mounjaro before I could do this and I’m not even sure I could since I don’t have a diabetes diagnosis, I’m just clinically obese. 

Any insight? Is Mounjaro better enough to switch? I guess I’m basing this off the fact that Wegovy isn’t working as well and Mounjaro saw a 21% loss versus a 15% loss for Wegovy.

I understand it’s just a starter dose but I just hoped of something a bit more I can’t lie. Gym has been an absolute write off I’ve done 3 sessions since I started the first one I left as I felt so sick, second one was fine the last one was awful I felt so sick throughout the whole day.

Can I use my current Rx and transfer it to a (insert a pharmacy / online pharmacy of your recommendation here) and fill it? I do see a clinic by me that prescribes the prefilled syringes starting at $250 for the initial doses and up to $400 for the highest dose.

They told me it shouldn’t be a problem since I had the Prior Auth approved anyways so I gladly switched to an out of pocket plan.

Last month I posted asking what everyone was doing to get healthful in January.

My goals were to eat 30 different plants a week and build up to walking 10k steps a day.

I achieved the 30 plants a week and feel healthier for it.  I think it helped me eat more nutritious food overall and definitely got my five fruits and veg a day while working towards my goal.  I'm going to keep it going.  

My tip would be front load your week with lots of variety, it's hard trying to find seven novel plants to eat at 7pm on a Sunday!  Also lots of fresh herbs.

Secondly, I was aiming to build up to 10k steps a week.  I got up to 9500 daily then felt an old plantar injury niggling.  I listened to my body and eased off, so I am kind of proud of myself for having that awareness.

I am trying to build better and more sustainable habits. Sure I could probably go without eating all day but, that's not realistic for the long term and once I stop Wegovy, I'd probably gain back everything.

In April, my doc moved me to the 2.4 dose and the first week was ok, but the second and third week resulted in severe “expulsion” in the middle of the night a few days after the dose.  My doc put me back onto 1.7 and I had been there through the rest of the year.  I had gotten down below 220 lbs at one point but after Christmas I was back up to 228 after being at 225 for several months: I had plateaued having only lost 10lbs over the year. 

Discussing with my doctor, he believed the only way to keep up progress was to go back to the 2.4.  He addressed my concerns of getting violently sick again saying my body probably would be used to it.  After getting the new dosage I was still very concerned and came here looking for info.  

Many folks would have issues within hours of taking their dose.  However my issues were several days later.  Fortunately I found several of you comment on how wegovy works to slow down digestion and as a result the digestive system can become overloaded resulting in expulsion from both ends.  Many recommended laxatives and smaller meals to keep things moving.  

So here’s what worked for me:  I started taking laxatives once a day as well as try to keep to intermittent fasting (little to nothing after dinner).  The first week I did have the usual reaction waking up at 2 am and being in the bathroom for over an hour.  That week there was vomiting. This last week I made it through without being woken up! It’s now 2 days past the typical window of expulsion so I’m feeling thankful.  

So far while on the 2.4 dose (3 weeks) I’ve lost 5 lbs.  slow and steady progress.

Starting weight: 104,2 kg (229 lbs) and today 4 weeks later it is 98 kg (216 lbs).  
I have lost 6,2 kg (13 lbs) and 30 centimeters (1,2 inch) in total. I couldn't be happier and more proud. 

I have tried to loose weight many, many times (as most of us probably have!). With Wegoyv it has been so much easier - I have without a problem eaten around 1600 calories a day focusing on protein and fibers. 

Wegovy has helped me to have a neutral relationship with food - I can still enjoy it but I don't crave food all. the. time! I just eat to get full and then stop. This is what it must feel to be a ""normal sized person"". It has also helped me reduce my cravings for alcohol - which both helps the weightloss and myself. 

The side effects are minimal. I have had no trouble with any stomach issues (I think this is because of my water and fiber intake). The first week I had a light headache and a little dizziness after the first shot. But nothing since!

I hope I can stay on a lower dosis for as long as possible - because I really like this feeling of being in control of my diet without it being to strict or hard.

Pretty much my entire adult life has been “you need to lose weight” for every single medical issue, even though I’ve always been active and in immaculate health all around. Yet, still consistently fucking discredited every chance I get. Fast forward to hearing about wegovy. I ask my doctor about it, turns out Kaiser doesn’t support weight loss drugs, refuses to write me a script and I can’t get it covered anyway. So I try Mexico. All out of stock. So I wait 9 months and change insurance carriers. I see people in this subreddit all the time who are a lot smaller than me and got approved so I think there’s even the tinniest smidge of hope lmao and then my doctor says that insurance probably won’t approve because I’m in such good health and dont have another pre existing health condition. So I’ve been told to lose weight my entire life but now I’m too healthy for assisted weight loss? Rad lmao love it. After some back and forth with my doctor, she finally writes me a script to which now of course it’s too little too late because now I can’t find .25 anywhere in San Diego or Southern California. I’m so tired dude. It was like pulling teeth to get my doctor to even consider writing a script for me. 

My entire life, I’ve dreamed about a drug like wegovy. I’m active, I eat alright. My issue is that I’m only 5’0 and gained all my weight rapidly over some tough times in my life. 1500 calories as an active big person is really hard for me to hit. So I thought wegovy would help me get more fit so that I can go back to my active lifestyle without my body hurting all the damn time. I miss surfing. I miss all the things I used to do (mainly because I can’t fit in gear). Idk I just think I’m a great candidate and wish this drug could be available to all of us.

That all being said, I'm really concerned about my mental health. I've struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life, and the last two nights have left me in crying ""spirals"" where it's almost impossible to stop crying. A lot of these attacks come out of the blue, but they haven't happened to me in at least a year. While on Wegovy, I've been in a relatively good mood during the daytime but at night, I kind of fall apart.

To be fair, I'm going through a hell of a time right now (I'm essentially living out of a suitcase for my job, multiple family health emergencies, other major family drama, extremely frustrating work situations), so I'm really hoping it's just things being crazy rather than the medication.

I know Wegovy can sometimes increase depressive symptoms — has anyone had this happen? How do you manage your mental health while on Wegovy?",2024-01-31,1,9,Wegovy
1af9hzz,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"My husband wants to try Wegovy. So, my husband has a BMI of over 50.  We have talked about weitloss surgery but he really don't want to do that. We contacted and met with a weighloss doctor and she referred us to a dietitian and he has a sleep study appointment tomorrow. 
He has in the last few weeks started to log and measure his food and excersise and he is losing weight.  The thing is, he has done this before. Many times and it's a real struggle. Luckily he has no other health issues.  He was tested for diabetes and it came back negative.  Blood pressure is good. All his lab results were great. Which is odd considering his size.  We have heard of this weighloss drug ozempic but from.what I understand it's a drug meant for people with diabetes not not covered by insurance . But then I found out about Weygovi and that drug is for people with Obisety.  
Can you be prescribed Weygovi by your doctor even if you don't have diabetes or high blood pressure?

I'm sorry if this has been answered before.

1af9a7m,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Progress report. Started Wegovy in mid October 2023

4 weeks @.25 -lost 4 lbs
8 weeks @.5  
1 week @ 1.0


Lost 31.5 lbs total so far, but 10 of those lbs were from starting the Mediterranean Diet first in June. I’m 5’9. 

Still have at least 60 lbs to go, and probably more though I can scarcely believe it’s possible. But already have dropped at least a pant size and my clothes are starting to fit loosely. I am walking daily -easier now w 30 less lbs to carry around! 

I have had some constipation issues this last week, but extra water, fiber, walking and senna are helping. I am ratcheting down the fat too and that is also helping. 

I don’t recommend skipping the earlier doses. It takes time to learn new habits. I’m grateful my doc suggested stretching out the .5 on the way up. I also am staying w my mom after knee surgery and doc suggested staying in .5 during this time so weight loss has slowed a bit. 

I’m told that I am very unusual to get these kinds of results at lower doses so please do not measure your progress against mine! 


Next stop: 50 lbs down!

1af5pwd,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Can they approve then deny prior authorizations. My first prior authorization was approved for July 2023 thru December 2023. In that time I was only able to get 3 months total due to shortage. If there wasn't a shortage I obviously would have been able to get 6 months worth so insurance should be happy they only had to cover 3 of the 6.  Then I get a PA approved for Jan 2024 thru June 2024. So as soon as I found it in stock I order a refill and and am told I can't refill it until November. I call and they say that is correct, you can't refill until November. Obviously it makes no sense to approve a PA thru June but not allow a refill until November. Member services says call the PA dept. So I do and they contact the doctor who told them my next refill should be now not November, then the denied the PA. 

This was the reason given ""Coverage for additional drug quantities is provided if re-initiation of treatment is needed due to more than two consecutive missed doses. Additional coverage cannot be authorized at this time"" 

If I was only able to get three months worth during the first PA of July 2023 thru Dec 2023 I obviously had lots of missed doses in that time frame. Now they won't cover it because I have currently missed more than 2 consecutive doses?? Why was it ok to miss consecutive doses last year but not this year? Why is this considered ""additional drug quantities"" when no additional drugs have been given. If anything I've received less drugs than originally approved. Can they approve then deny a PA? And can they just decide they don't like 2 consecutive missed doses when the doctor has been ok with it (I haven't had any problems when missing doses)?

My doctor has sent in an appeal spelling out when I've received all refills and when I actually took each dose. Of course it make take up to 15 days to hear their decision.

About 6pm I start feeling sick and say I don’t want to eat dinner today I may have some later. I have been at this job in 5 months and I have never not eaten dinner ever, I am usually the one that cooks. I thought that I did have a big meal not long ago so didn’t think too much about it. At 8pm I went on a drive for an hour and came back with some fruit. I had some pineapple, mango and grapes in a bowl at about 10pm. I ate the whole lot, struggled a bit at the end with the grapes a few too many but that was my dinner. My shift finished at 11pm and I go downstairs to the sleep room to go bed.

1b3ggre,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Cycle off, then back on.  Anyone else done this?. SW 204, CW 177.  I’ve been on 2.4 since 12/29, started 8/4/23.   I’ve been stuck at 177 since 1/19.  I will gain and lose the same 1-2 pounds.  I’ve searched the thread and read many posts about plateaus.  I’m drinking more water than when I first started, I recalculated my calorie goals to adjust for my weight loss. I’m exercising 2-3 times per week (walk 30min, then weights 30min) and my protein is 130-150g per day.  I realize I could exercise more, but my work job has an exercise component and it’s hard to fit in more outside that.  ’ve read about intermittent fasting, but I’m not sure that is for me.  And here I sit still at a plateau. 

I’m curious if others have taken a break for a month or two then restarted.  I realize I would need to titrate back up.  I am in the medical field and confident in splitting my 2.4mg syringes to then restart. My doctor and I even discussed doing this when I hit maintenance.

1b3g5qn,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"All I can say is: ""Wow!"" . From what I read online I was not expecting to see any results or notice a major change for at least a few weeks or longer, especially considering I am on the starter dose, but that was not the case for me.

I am only 5 days into my Wegovy journey and I have noticed a huge shift in my overall appetite as well as my self-control when it comes to food. I was the type who could always be counted on to clean my plate, regardless of how much food was on it. My portion sizes were way out of whack and my cravings were too.

In less than a week, that has completely changed. When I go to a restaurant, I now need a to-go box. Instead of snacking all day long and eating big lunches and dinners, I have a light lunch and a small dinner and few, if any, snacks.

I am already down nearly 7 pounds as of my most recent weigh-in (which was immediately after dinner, so should have been worst case scenario). Side effects so far are also very minor, and manageable.

I know this isn't everyone's experience, but I have found Wegovy to be a very powerful tool to add to my tool chest for losing weight. It still requires being thoughtful and making good choices, but it makes making those good choices so much easier.",2024-03-01,18,3,Wegovy

I'm on week 3 of Wegovy, my doctor just straight up started me on 1mg Dose (i'm coming from a really high number).  Anywho, I received the wegovy via USPS, so I assumed it was safe to be left out.  There wasn't any thermal packing of any kind.   I asked about delivery for my 1.7mg dose, but was told it needed to be picked up since it had to be refrigerated.  And that's when the ""oh sh\*t"" moment happened lol.  I did read it was fine if left out for 28 days, so I imagine maybe about 24 or so with shipping time.  I threw it in the fridge  with the new dose immediately.

My first week was potent, worked as it should, lost 5lbs, constipated, food noise muted a ton. The effects felt less in week 2, less in week 3.  It's still working, albeit I feel the effects less.  I wonder if it's a case of my body getting used to it, or was leaving it out lowering it's effectiveness, or is it just a normal cycle for anyone who's at the beginning?

It’s less than a pound a week on average which is disappointing compared to a lot of the stories on here, but a loss is a loss however small. 

A few weeks ago my weight loss stopped. I also noticed that the food noise was back, I was feeling hungry all the time and craving sugar and carbs again. I had been on 1.7 for 3 weeks already, so I figured it must be a sign that I need to increase the dose next time I ordered. In the mean time I took the 4th injection of 1.7mg as usual. 

Within 24 hours of taking the injection I suddenly started getting terrible side effects. Bloating and stomach pain, nausea and intense vomiting for 24 hours, followed by body aches and exhaustion for a couple more days after. I had to take time off work and it was really debilitating. 

I decided not to increase the dose and kept it at 1.7mg. However, I got the same side effects again with the next 2 doses too. If anything they may even have been worse.

Now I’m due to take another dose tomorrow and I’m so scared to take it. I feel hungry all the time and the scale hasn’t moved in a month, but the side effects… I don’t know what to do 😬

1b34fo8,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Wegovy Week 1 - Observations and Results. I am coming up to the end of my first week on .25mg of Wegovy. I took it last Friday (February 23) around 2:30pm and plan to take it tomorrow (March 1) at the same time. Here is what I've noticed.

**Stats:**

* Height: 5'7""
* Age: 37
* **SW:** 259.8 (Usually oscillates btwn 158-162 depending on the day)
* **CW:** 252 (Factoring in that it's all water weight)

**Side effects:**

* Nausea and vomiting: The nausea I experienced was minimal and mostly occurred Day 2 and Day 3 and went away with Dramamine for nausea. Also a peptol bismol in a tablet. No vomiting to speak of.
* Fatigue: I experienced fatigue directly after taking it and then the next day (almost passed out during a movie), but I have since bounced back to normal and do feel I even have an extra spring in my step.
* Constipation: I've not experienced any constipation and ind in fact it has improved as I am now taking Psyllium Husk caps for my daily dose of fiber, in addition to my regular multivitamin. (HIGHLY recommended!)
* Misc: Mild headaches throughout the week, mostly from forgetting to eat (big ADHD problem) when I'm hungry. Also some mild burping on day 2.

**Appetite and food noise:**

* Appetite is normal. I've not noticed any real dip on my hunger signals, though when I do go to eat, I am finding I take 3-4 bites and I'm disinterested. So the hunger cue to eat is still there but once I do, I feel pretty bored and complacent doing it.
* Food noise was impacted almost immediately and I haven't found it too difficult to make healthier substitutions than I used to. I haven't had much processed food this week aside from a Chipotle bowl (if that counts?) and a bowl from Cava ( (if that also counts?). Again, I just don't feel that interested. (So long as I can't smell it or see it)
* Premier protein shakes have been a life saver so far. 
* STILL having to remind myself to drink a ton of water.

**Fitness:**

* I've bought some 5 lb and 8 lb hand weights that I plan to implement into my walks. I live in an urban environment without a car, so walking is a day-to-day thing - I have no issues getting my steps in, but I hope to integrate weights into my routine to help tone my arms. 
* I've scoped out a few gyms in my area but I'm just not there yet in terms of confidence or motivation or energy. Hopefully soon.

In addition to all of this I've started to take collagen supplements to aid with thinning hair. There is also biotin in my multivitamin (Olly), as well as Vitamins A, Bs, D, C, E, Zinc, Folic Acid. If anyone has any further recommendations, please feel free to share. 

All in all, I'm feeling really good, positive, and motivated, and I really hope to continue on this trajectory, though I do hope my weight loss evens out going forward once I've shed the water weight. Just knowing (so far) that I *can* lose weight on the medication has been a blessing, and I hope the shortages don't impact my ability to continue on it at a regular pace/titration.",2024-02-29,3,2,Wegovy

I read a lot on this forum and others before I started Wegovy and saw it talked about a good bit but didn’t really understand until now.  I was never one to sit and think about food, snacks, or my next meal. So when I heard people say it quiets the food noise I was perplexed because I didn’t have the noise or thoughts they were talking about  🤷‍♂️  I’m literally on shot #2 of the .25 dose and I’m not sure I can fully articulate the difference in my head.  Before, while I didn’t think about food, if someone asked at lunch what’s for dinner I might say oh tacos sound good, or what about pizza, etc.  Now if someone asks it’s like I’m looking at a TV channel with static.

1b2xkw8,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Week 1 of 0.25mg complete! 10lbs lost!. As the title says, I just finished my first week of 0.25mg and I’m over the moon. I’m 26m and my starting weight was 272lbs and weighing myself this morning read 262lbs! understandably a good amount of this will be water weight that has been lost but still! Other than a bit of a funny tummy and the occasional headache (thankfully subsiding quickly after hydrating), the side effects have been minimal in terms of the impact on my day to day life. Up until late into Tuesday (today now being Thursday), I experienced a nicely suppressed appetite but late into Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday I started feeling a little more hungry which required me to be a little stricter with myself, which I was able to do easier than any previous diet attempt.

In terms of what I’ve eaten, I’ve made a conscious effort to consume whole foods and cut out processed items. I’ve made sure to keep my protein intake up as much as possible while tracking everything. I plan to introduce more and more balance to my life going forward but it was more a case of showing myself it was possible to eat that way, give myself a foundation to build on and also I actually learned to enjoy the cooking process as I haven’t been desperately trying to get the food in my stomach. I haven’t exceeded 1500 calories all week since I started and have mostly hovered around the 1000-1200 range. 

Overall my long term plan is to live a healthier and more balanced life. I would like to be able to eat my favourite foods in moderation, be more active in my general day to day life as I’ve spent many years being sedentary with periods of attempting to lose weight and exercise. It was important to me within this process to give myself a foundation for that balanced life and a bit of a reset to build up from. I feel fantastic and my sleep has been better than it has in a long time, frequently getting 7-8 hours instead of my usual 4-5. So far the differences I’ve noticed in my overall life have been amazing and I’ve even found myself feeling less anxious and much more hopeful than I typically do.

&#x200B;

The evening before the latest weigh-in brought me back to the football field, an endeavor that, in hindsight, might have benefitted from a bit more recovery time post-half marathon. The aftereffects of that physical milestone were more pronounced than anticipated, leaving me feeling significantly depleted. This exhaustion wasn't just physical; it seeped into my gameplay, leading to uncharacteristic technical errors and lapses in performance that I couldn't seem to shake off.

This experience served as a stark reminder of the delicate balance between pushing oneself towards ambitious goals and allowing adequate time for rest and recuperation. Despite the passion and drive that fuel my love for the game and pursuit of fitness milestones, the body's need for rest to recharge its batteries is undeniable. The intensity of the half marathon, followed too closely by a demanding football game, underscored the importance of listening to my body's signals, even when my enthusiasm pushes me to jump back into action sooner than advisable.

Reflecting on this, the lesson is clear: recovery is not just a pause in activity but an essential component of progress and performance. As I continue on this journey, balancing the rigors of physical challenges with the necessity of rest will be crucial for sustaining momentum and avoiding setbacks. It's a reminder that sometimes, the best move is to step back, recharge, and approach the next game or goal with renewed energy and focus.

Today marked the sixth injection day in the trial, and my second dose at 0.5 mg unfolded smoothly. The ritual of fasting overnight, rising early, and heading out for the trial has become a familiar sequence. Following the routine blood draws and weigh-in, I find myself facing an amusing anomaly in my daily life: breakfast at the trial. Ironically, it's the one occasion I indulge in a morning meal, lured by the complimentary sandwiches at the cafeteria, a small but appreciated perk of participation.

This week's weigh-in showed a significant drop to 93.8 kg (206.8 lbs), shedding 1.6 kg (3.5 lbs) from the previous week's 95.4 kg (210.3 lbs). This notable reduction feels particularly rewarding, likely fueled by the aftereffects of Monday's half marathon and possibly making up for the slower pace of weight loss in earlier weeks.

Reflecting on this achievement, I can't help but feel a surge of satisfaction. The journey, with its highs and lows, continues to unfold in surprising and gratifying ways. This week's strong performance not only boosts my spirits but also heightens my anticipation for what lies ahead. The path of progress, with each injection and each milestone, is a narrative of personal growth and evolving goals.",2024-02-29,1,0,Wegovy

1b2tf6x,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Online programs to assist with insurance coverage. Hi!
I have ""good"" insurance that looks like it should cover Wegovy for weight loss. Per their requirements, the only hurdle seems to be that I'd have to spend 6 months in a weight loss program like WW, or another ""physician approved weight loss plan"" before it could be covered. I've been trying to lose weight (that I gained after a traumatic period of my life) for 18 months, but not in any specific program, just exercise and calorie-counting. My PCP knows that I exercise and have been trying to lose weight, but again, not in any sort of program. Despite this, I've continued to gain weight, which is why I looked into a GLP-1 medication.
I've seen some online services like Calibrate that can assist with insurance coverage-- does anyone have any experiences with them or recommendations? Do any of these services really go to bat for you to get coverage? Specifically, would any of them be comfortable certifying that I've tried to lose weight through physician-approved diet and nutrition so I won't have to pay uselessly for WW? All these services seem to have god-awful reviews, but I'm curious if others have experience with them.
I like my PCP a lot, but I don't know that this office is going to go all-out in helping me with the prior authorization/hurdles with my insurance company (which is fair, they're busy), which is why I'm considering an online service.

Pre-Wegovy I would say I was a moderate to heavy drinker. Drinking to get drunk at least once a week. When starting Wegovy, I challenged myself to take a month off alcohol as well as eating well & exercising. I’ve lost 20lbs! 

Yesterday was my husband’s birthday. We booked a night away in a hotel and knew I’d be eating a nice meal & drinking. 

Over the course of a few hours I had 2 beers and 4 glasses of wine. Enough for anyone but nowhere near the amount that I used to drink. We sat down for a lovely steak dinner, which I could only haves a few bites of. I thought I would try & have my favourite dessert (the sugary delicious Sticky Toffee Pudding) after seeing as I barely ate my main - one bite of that & nope, that sent me over the edge and straight to the toilet bowl!

1bsszot,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"How to Find a Good Provider (and stay out of the ER). I have read several awful experiences of people across Reddit who went to the ER because of incorrect GLP1 dosing by their doctor, or had other major complications with gallbladders and such. Stories that sounded like they might have been avoidable, at least in some cases, if the person was seeing a more experienced doctor.

Someone asked me how to find a good prescriber. As someone who has taken GLP1s continuously for nearly 11 years with my super badass endocrinologist, with no adverse effects and barely any side effects, that is expertise I can share. So here goes. 

The landscape right now is most primary care, Gyns and OBs do not have the expertise in GLP1s to be managing them. Of course there are exceptions. But generally, it will be several years before your typical primary care doc really knows how to manage them. They just haven't had enough run time because most ony started prescribing in the last 2 years or so.

The providers who are most likely to have the knowledge and experience are:  1) Doctors boarded in Obesity medicine (could be any kind of doctor who has gotten this additional credential; see the doctor lookup below) 2) Endocrinologists, and 3) Bariatricians who aren't 100% surgery focused and have been prescribing for some years. Those are your best bets for doctors who know what they are doing.
 
I personally think your best bet is to find a well recommended, local doctor on your health plan that fits these profiles. I think you get better care versus with an unknown telehealth provider at a for-profit company. If you go with a telehealth provider, it's even more critical that you be educated on GLP1s and ask tough questions (more on that below).

Beforw you see anyone, educate yourself on how GLP1s are managed. 

When you make an appt, you can screen potential providers by aaking, does this provider regularly prescribe and manage patients taking GLP1s? How many approximately? If they say no, or give a low number, don't go with them. 

When you see the doctor, interview them about their experience level. How long have they been prescribing them? How do they handle side effects, etc.? What dose do you start people at and how do you decide when to move up a dose?  How often do you see patients on GLP1s to monitor them? How do they feel about someone being on it for life?

You want someone that wants to see you probably monthly in the beginning, then every few months when you're stable and doing well. You want them to at least be open to lifelong use, because some people need that, but not all do.

If you have done your homework, you should be able to figure out in one visit, i.e., one copay, if they know what they are doing. You should know what the starting doses are for the different drugs so you can tell if they give you the right answer. You should know the dosing instructions and dosing schedule for them. Know the side effects and ask them to tell you about them and note if they leave any out. Basically, do your research so you can be confident in their knowledge and experience.

Honestly, it is the wild west out there right now in terms of providers, and it will be a few years before it settles. So protect yourself!

The same 10 pounds. Recently though I’ve gained an additional 15 and I feel horrible. Although I know it’s 100% because I’ve been overeating, like ungodly amounts of food. For some reason I can’t tell if I’m full or hungry or what. I used to be able to clearly feel when I’ve had enough and was satisfied but now my hunger queues are gone. I can’t tell if I’m full unless I’m in physical pain from overeating. All I think about is food. Even now I’m thinking about left over Easter dinner. Im disgusted with myself. Why am I so ravenous, why can’t I get enough and be normal? I have a pretty sedentary job and over all life style. I recently got a gym member ship but a part of me thinks only working out for maybe an hour then laying down the rest of the day isn’t going to help. I’ve been thinking about activities outside the gym that will get me moving but I’m broke and everything is expensive, I thought about yoga or Pilates but I can’t afford it and Ik for a fact I won’t do it at home constantly. I feel unmotivated and have no discipline. I’m slowly becoming uninterested in things I usually do. Idk they just don’t hit the same way. Food is the only thing that comforts me. But I also feel disgusted and hatred towards food and myself. I do desperately want to lose weight and feel good in my body. I’ve been fantasizing about being skinny all my life.

I have seen many others on this sub feel concerned about their plateaus or discouraged by “only” losing 5-10 pounds the first month, wondering if the injections are not working for them - I want to remind you that it’s normal! Firstly, the medication needs time to fully build up in your system (slowly increasing dosage is the only way to safely do this). Secondly, for the average person, healthy weight loss is considered losing a maximum of 1-2 lbs per week. While some may exceed that, it is the exception and not the rule. I just wanted to share my stats and some progress pics to show others what a realistic first month can look like!

I’m excited to see what numbers for month 2 look like! I’m planning on posting an update then as well :)

(trigger warning I will be talking about digestive related stuff so if you think that’s TMI, please leave lol) I finally got a hold of the .25 dose of Wegovy last wednesday and decided to just say fuck it and took my first shot that same day before I went to bed. 

On thursday I felt mostly okay just a bit of indigestion and definitely loss of appetite. Yesterday was about the same and then I woke up at 6am sweating and my chest felt a little tight, almost thought I was having a heart attack but I got an EKG like last month and everything was normal + my vitals were also normal. Also, I’m 24 years old with no known health issues other than being obese with slightly high cholesterol but I have been eating relatively healthy so I doubted it was a heart attack and went back to sleep. I felt better today heart wise but as the day progressed the indigestion just got worse. 

I bought some alkaseltzer heartburn + gas relief pills thinking that would help with the indigestion and it did. I had dinner and right after I did not feel good. I started getting those familiar cramps and had to go to the bathroom where I had a bit of diarrhea. I normally have a pretty strong stomach before wegovy so this sucked. 

Now I am just sitting and wondering if I should even take my next dose next week. I don’t know if this is worth it. If this is how bad my digestive system is now on the lowest dose, I am afraid of how it’s going to be on the higher doses? I just feel like I would rather continue to try to lose weight on my own, even though that will be hard. I don’t know if I want to deal with all of this digestive issue stuff plus that random weird heart attack feeling symptom (could have been heart burn idk).

I've previously lost about 50kg by counting calories, but after 10 years the weight has startet to get back on. So I know everything about diet and exercise.   


My problem is that I have not felt any of the effects that I hoped for; I've not lost appetite, I still manage to eat large meals without problems (although sometimes I get sick, which is a well known side effect when eating to much).   


Obviously the medication is supposed to help in those areas so that it's easier to maintain a calorie deficit.

Why is it so hard to actually get a doctor to prescribe Wegovy? My primary care physician said told me back in July, that it was covered by my insurance, but that she wanted me to workout for three months and come back for a follow-up appointment. She said that she would see how my results were, and document them (though my insurance company didn’t require this at all) and then she would give me the prescription. I have BCBS-Federal and all they require is a BMI over 30. Mine is 33.9. After three months, I returned and she said she wanted me to get bloodwork. I got the bloodwork done and came back a third time and she said that she the owner of the medical practice didn’t want any of the doctors on staff to prescribe any medication for weight loss. I was deflated because I had done everything she had asked. I tried one of the “Weight Loss Centers.” They said that they did take insurance but only after the first three months. They said that they had their own supply of the lower doses of Wegovy but I would have to pay $420 bucks a month (and a consultation fee) for the first three months and THEN they would begin to use my insurance. I called BCBS to see if the lower doses were covered and was told that they were. Long story short, the “doctor” at the center said that the lower doses were on back order and she wouldn’t take any kind of insurance for the first three months no matter what. Next, I called around in my town to see if I could find a doctor who would prescribe it to me would prescribe it to me. I found someone who agreed to do so and went to the appointment with all recent bloodwork and the last year of my medical history from my PCP.  At the appointment, the doctor lectured me about how I had ate my way to my current BMI and that she was only going to prescribe me Wegovy after I tried her personal weight loss program first. She went on and on for two hours. I asked why she had told me to come in the first place if she had no intention of giving me the medication. She said that I “came in with my mind made up” about wanting Wegovy but I had a “hand and mouth problem.” She then motioned as if she were eating food to show illustrate her point. At this point I am trying Sequence. I have an appointment set for April 1st. I am paying 99 dollars per month for something FREE through my insurance. This is crazy but I can’t find anyone in the DMV (Maryland near Baltimore) to help me with prescribing it.

For the first 3 months I didn’t think it was working; I didn’t feel any different, no side effects, still ate the usual stuff. The last month I’ve had everything hit me like a truck. And I’m really fed up of these horrid sulphur burps, diarrhoea and being sick. I’m on 1 mg at the moment. Last weekend I didn’t take the full dose, counted 44 clicks to be roughly 0.75 as I’m on my Easter break and didn’t want it to be tainted by being scared to leave the house in case I need to urgently use a toilet. 
The side effects have been less intense, but still unforgiving. I haven’t had any fried food for weeks, what I’ve learnt also sets me off is anything with flavour- garlic and any sort of spices. So I’m eating everything bland. I had a homemade roast dinner yesterday with my family. I left half of the chicken, roasted potatoes, Yorkshire pudding etc. I just concentrated on the veg, but I still woke up to sulphur burps this morning. (I think chicken with skin on sets me off too) 

But anyway- im heading to Oslo next week. First break abroad for a while and im not liking the thought of it. I’ll struggle to trust eating anything and when I do I know I’ll be constantly anxious to locate the nearest toilet. 

I’ve bought Gaviscon for the GERD, expensive ginger tea, digestive enzymes and hydration tablets… I still get caught of guard. 

I live off mainly soup, bread, ritz crackers, grapes, apples, bananas and occasionally yogurt. I take the injection on Saturdays (so due another tonight) and by Thursday I can sometimes manage a normal-ish meal of something mild.

Pretty miserable stuff. I haven’t seen a huge weight difference but then again it has only been 3 weeks since this medication has actually been seen to do its job. 

I’m toying with either decreasing the dose to maybe 0.5 on my pen by counting the clicks on the 1mg pen. Or just packing it in completely. 

This has really messed with my personal and professional life (I had previously posted about having to have multiple days off work because of this!) 

I guess I’m reflecting a lot as to why I’m really relying on this injection to loose weight. I lead a really busy life and was careless with food choices out of comfort or convenience. I used to go to the gym a lot but got disheartened when there was no progress so turned to this injection. But now I’m too riddled with unpredictable side effects to dare to go and work out!?

1chc8np,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"High Sex Drive, Side effect? . Hello Everyone, 

I have serious matter to discuss with you guys. I have been experiencing, which I suspect may be related to my medication, Ozempic, which I have been taking for the past 8 - 9 months.

Recently, I have started to experience a heightened sense of arousal and high sex drive, which occurs frequently throughout the day, irrespective of my environment or activities. This has become quite challenging to manage, especially since I am currently without a partner.

I am concerned that these feelings may be a side effect of Ozempic. Despite these issues, the medication has been effective for my original health goals, and I would prefer not to discontinue its use unless absolutely necessary.

Before making any changes, I wanted to consult with you guys to understand if this is a known side effect or if it might be influenced by other factors. I am hesitant to contact my doctor, I think he might stop the medication which might impede the progress I have made towards my health goals.

Can someone advise me on how to proceed with this issue? If anyone know anything let me know. 

Thank you..",2024-05-01,2,6,Ozempic
1chbyro,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"TW: Body Dismorphia. I hope this is okay to post here. I started my journey in March, 6 weeks ago. Since then I am down 8 lbs which is AMAZING. I have worked out consistently 5-6 days a week, never missing 2 days in a row. I have lost a couple of inches & my measurements are now Chest: 42 Waist: 33.5 and Hips: 42. Weight is now 169 from 177. 

My issue is not with any of those measurements…my issue is that my Chest/shoulders & back are so much bigger than the rest of me. I look like an NFL linebacker. Not kidding!! I tend to “scoop” my shoulders forward to make them seem smaller, but in doing this, it makes my shoulder blades wider, making my back seem wider!! Which my back is already wide. If I hold my shoulders back my back is still larger than the rest of me, but now my shoulders are also larger. None of my clothes fit properly due to this, my boobs end up being cut off by straps or sleeves since my chest is so wide. I’ve been working on arms/back/chest exercises to tone the problem areas, but it’s just my body type…do any of y’all deal with issues like this?? Any advice to what I can do to boost my confidence even with these body image issues I have? Do you think lipo would help my problem areas look smaller? I’ve been doing low weight high reps to hopefully tone for around 6 months now. 

For reference my arms are 14” & my waist is 33.5. Each arm is almost half my waist size….my heaviest weight was when I was pregnant, 202. I bounced around 185-190 while not pregnant. Please help. I know you can’t target one area with weight loss but it’s my biggest insecurity, I get anxious when someone stands behind me because I know they’re looking at the size of my back & shoulders…",2024-05-01,6,6,GLP-1

I asked him about it; he didn't bring it up. My BMI is 29.5, so I'm not obese but I am definitely overweight. I've been trying to lose the same 20-30 lbs for most of my life.

I'm currently waiting for the pharmacy to see if insurance approves it. If they do, I'm starting to have second thoughts about whether to go on it and I'd appreciate peoples' advice.

1ch2kej,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Insurance madness. Hi everyone. So I have no idea what to do here. I initially had no problem getting approved through my insurance in August of 2023 through Sequence which is telehealth. I’ve experienced lifelong obesity, had a lap band at 22 which helped my keep from getting back to my highest weight of 280 but the band ultimately failed and I was back to around 230 at 5’4. 

This past month my prior auth was up and it got denied (I’m not even at goal although I’ve gotten down to 160 from 230). My primary wants me at 125.  I still have high cholesterol and sleep apnea. 
My prior auth got denied because insurance wants an in person weight in.
And then it also says my BMI doesn’t meet requirements anymore. 
And then it says I need to prove my weight isn’t from an underlying health condition. 
And then I also need to prove I’m not taking another GLP-1 or have any gaps in treatment. 
I’m so frustrated. It seems like they are just stacking against me so that I get denied no matter what.  I can definitely go the compounding route which I have an appointment for on Monday but I want to be on this long term and feel like I’ll never be able to get it covered now that I’m having to stop the name brand Wegovy. I can swing compounded for the long term but I shouldn’t have to. 

Sequence has also been absolutely zero help with this. They won’t send me for a biometric screening at Quest to try to see if insurance will accept it, they won’t fill out a form for me to get help from Novo Nordisk to get an advocate to reach out to my insurance. It’s ridiculous. I was so happy with them from the start but now I’m upset with them and disappointed that they won’t do a damn thing to help with this denial. They won’t help me at all with the paperwork.

My insurance is repeatedly denying any attempt at pre-authorization despite Wegovy being a covered anti obesity med. I can't afford it at cash price but I'm getting bombarded with ads for compounded semaglutide (at prices I can afford) from a variety of online companies. 

My PCP says ""insurance never pays for it ever ever ever"" which I know isn't true, but my cardiologist is basically yelling at me to get on this med (but won't prescribe it).

Are any of these third-larty companies legitimate?  I feel like this med has the potential to change my life but I'm also wary of these various Facebook advertisers with sub-$300 semaglutide as I have been scammed before.

I spoke with a medical healthcare solutions clinic in my area but it seems rather experience -- **$297 for a doctor consult and then $399 for 5 weeks of injections. Is this good pricing?** I came across a site called Levity for semaglutide and it seems cheaper but since it's online only, I'm a bit spooked about the legitimacy and/or safety of going through Levity instead of my local clinic.

I just started packing away and donating all my “chub” clothes and started buying size medium tops! Omg! But the other day I saw that I gained 4 pounds back.  Yes I’m still on 2.4 wegovy.

We are a team of medical researchers studying the effects of popular GLP-1 agonists like Semaglutide (Wegovy, Ozempic, Rybelsus) on overactive bladder (OAB). Overactive bladder is a syndrome characterized by urinary urgency (the feeling of not being able to make it to the bathroom fast enough) with or without urge incontinence (urine leakage). People with OAB usually also have increased urination frequency, which may occur at night.

We're seeking participants for a survey to explore the role of GLP-1 agonists in treating Overactive Bladder (OAB). This anonymous survey takes just 5 minutes. Your input will assist medical researchers in shaping future studies and potentially improving treatment options. Join us in advancing OAB research!

Lost weight slow and steady (around 40 lbs).

took first dose of 2.4 and had same experience.

Here's where things started going sideways.

About 4-5 days after my second 2.4 dose, I started feeling extremely ill- painful stomach cramps, sever nausea/vomiting and eventually some minor diarrhea. There were days here and there I had to just stay in bed, or near the toilet all night. 8-9 days after that second injection, i felt better and took a third dose of 2.4. Again, after 4-5 days, I was so sick I missed a couple days of work, laid in bed and ate almost nothing. (After shot 2, I did try to make sure I was properly hydrated, and taking in what protein I could manage.

It's now been 2 weeks since that injection, and i finally feel back to normal. I've got one more dose of 2.4, but thinking maybe I'll just take a partial dose.

I'm considering getting my next refill at 1.7 instead of 2.4, as i definitely don't want to feel like I have for the past 2 weeks, and cannot afford to miss much more work.

Would dropping back to 1.7 be the best option? Should I stay at 2.4, possibly spread the injections out more (10-14 days)?   Something else?

I wanted to titrate up to 10 of zepbound, but because I had some side effects 1 week (entirely my fault I wasn’t eating properly that week) my clinician wanted to keep me at 7.5. 

Since ES would not cover another month of 7.5, my Dr advised me that I could bridge the gap with Wegovy at 7.5 equivalent until I could move up to 10 of zepbound.

SW 244 CW 237 GW 175 Didn't have any side effects my first two doses, and I've tried to eat healthy and not too much.  After my 3rd dose, I started noticing a bit of heartburn, but taking a few Tums helped a lot.  This week especially I realized that I was very content with eating much less food, and have started out with plating half the food I made, and then deciding if I want to go back and finish the rest (and most of the time I'll set it aside and nibble on it the rest of the day).  Also I don't feel compelled to drink alcohol - I'm pretty much a one-drink-in-the-evening-and-sip sort of drinker, but making a drink doesn't sound very appealing right now.

So far, I'm very pleased.  I think the Wegovy process has made me more aware of what I'm putting in my body and after reading about various side effects, I've tried to minimize some of them by not eating a lot at one time, taking fiber daily, drinking lots and lots of water, etc.

Month 2 and 3 were the most noticeable with the reduction of cravings and food noise. It was great. I FINALLY for once in my life felt like I had control over the incessant urge to eat that has plagued me for as long as I can remember. 

But starting last week, once I started on the full 1.7 mg does, I noticed that the food noise and urge to not only eat, but to over eat unhealthy foods (sweets, McDonald’s, alcohol, etc..) was back. Fortunately, (or unfortunately depending on how you look at it) the nausea I feel on this medication prevented me a couple of times from eating all of the bad food I was craving. But there were many times last week were I just powered through and ate it all anyway, even though it made me feel physically ill.

1d4tpgm,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Hashimoto's and Wegovy. I am just wondering if anyone else has had this issue.  I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's when I was 13 years old.  It has been a struggle.  It affects absolutely every system in my body.  When my thyroid hormones are low, my cholesterol goes up, my blood sugar is higher, etc.  Also, it makes me starving all the time.  I made my way up to the 2.4 dose, and had lost 91 pounds.  My appetite was stable and still low.  Everything was great.  

Then....

I had a hysterectomy.  I knew it would cause SOME changes to my hormones, but between the pain pills which increased my hunger, and then the healing process, which decreased my thyroid levels, I gained 15 pounds (fat and inflammation) and was starving ALL THE TIME.  When my doctor found that my levels were low, and adjusted my meds, everything felt like it went on overdrive.  I am back to feeling vomitous, and can't eat much at all.

1d4ngrf,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Can maintenance be achieved through Intermittent fasting after getting off Wegovy? . **Bit of background:** I'd been on the heavier side most of my life (capping at about 235 in high school). I took an off-brand supplement (sold in Asia) and it helped me lose about 55lbs. It pretty much did the same thing Wegovy does (Suppresses Appetite) but was not sold in the US because it was not FDA approved.

After getting off those, I unknowingly did fasting for about the next 2 years after that and lost another 30lbs. (was busy with work, life, etc and just didn't eat as often or as much). 

I was at my lowest weight, 150lbs, for years. I watched what I ate but wasn't really strict or anything. I never really ate breakfast and worked-out almost daily for about 30-40 mins. I was able to maintain my weight for about 7 yrs. Gained a bit again due to stress and eating more. Got back down to 160 after getting into Intermittent fasting and Keto.

I have basically been able to maintain this weight moderately easily but then I got Pregnant and it all went down hill from there. (Can't fast or do keto while pregnant) I gained about 65lbs and ended up having Gestational Diabetes.

Here I am about 7 months Postpartum and my doctor has prescribed me Wegovy to help me lose weight.

*I know* I can probably lose the weight through fasting again but it's much harder this time psychologically since I had almost a year of eating whatever I wanted. It's not that I can't do it, I'm just being lazy mentally because I know I can and have succeeded in the past (Which may be another mental block - I know I can so I don't take any real effort to really go at it). I also know once I get past that initial starting hump, I will continue to just get back to my old eating habits of fasting and keto because I liked the results I had and it was one of the driving motivating factors of the lifestyle.

One of the reasons I haven't taken the wegovy yet is because I don't want to be on it for life or gain any of the weight back.   
**So I guess my questions is**, Do you think I can use it to sort of give me a boost into the weight loss and get back into my previous way of eating and eventually come off of it after a few months AND maintain my weight loss through eating clean and fasting? Has anyone tried this? I honestly don't want to have to take anything for life unless absolutely needed to live.

On another note, I have been getting back into fasting the last week and it's going alright.

**TLDR:** Used to be overweight, lost weight using Wegovy-like drug a long time ago. Got off said drug and maintained for many years. Gained some small amount of weight again. Lost it through fasting/keto. Gained weight while pregnant. Hard to get back into fasting again.

1dscn3x,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Is anyone else in college taking Wegovy. I started taking Wegovy mid March, I’ll be a junior in college this fall. I am just curious because I haven’t told any of my friends I’m taking this medication and interested in others experiences. 

I’ve never been naturally skinny, and since coming to college I gained 50lbs over 2 years. So I have definitely been bigger than my friends who are I’m guessing sizes 0-6. As 20 year old girls we have all unfortunately had issues with eating in the past and it’s a really uncomfortable topic, but I know that they do not share the struggles I have. I’m a big stress eater, which was one of the ways I gained a lot of weight in college. I’ve also had a lot of other things going on in my personal life that caused extreme stress levels for me while also being in college, and as a result I developed an enormous appetite. So here we are now lol. 

I’m not embarrassed at all about taking Wegovy. It’s been a miracle drug for me and I have been feeling great since taking it. But there’s so much “controversy” over weight loss drugs specifically on TikTok, if people without diabetes should take them or not. So I literally haven’t told anyone I’m taking this except my family. My health is my personal business but the difference is noticeable- not just losing weight but eating. A lot of times with friends does involve eating so to me it seems obvious that I can’t finish a meal anymore or eat snacks when I used to get midnight snacks with them all the time and order larger portions. 

I guess I just feel kind of weird about it. None of my friends have experienced this rapid weight gain that I have, and surely have seen this conversation about ozempic online. So I’m not really sure if I should tell them eventually or not. I also sometimes get extremely nauseous out of the blue so that’s another giveaway. 

I don’t want anyone to think badly of me for using this medication and especially from what they’ve seen online. My doctor prescribed it for me because of my BMI and I have tried everything else to curb my appetite, Wegovy is the only thing that did it so I do need this. Also, not that any of my friends would steal it, but I do worry that someone might try to take it from my fridge and resell it (I was living in a sorority house when I started). So I have my mini skincare fridge to keep it in lol. 

I’m just curious if anyone else is taking it while in college and has a similar experience! I can’t decide if I should ever tell my friends, since this summer I’ve lost a lot of weight pretty fast since I’ve been on 1.0 so I’m not sure how much longer I can keep it to myself before it does get really noticeable. And I am known to be someone who doesn’t love working out so if I were to say I exercised intensely it would be a lie lol, I try for 10,000 steps everyday. I would want to be transparent if someone asked but I don’t want to be judged or hear someone else’s opinions about weight loss drugs because it works for me🤷🏻‍♀️",2024-06-30,4,6,Both

1ds44e8,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"New dose (.5)  just before a 3-4 day business trip?. Hi all. Thank you for sharing your experiences here. It’s been so helpful for someone like me- a BIG planner & hater of surprises. Learning about side effects changing when going up a dose has been especially eye opening.

I just realized I’m scheduled to go up to .5 just before a three or four day business trip (my first since before the pandemic). I inject on Friday nights - thanks to info from this group and just did my second .25 the other day - and I would be leaving on a Monday. Since it’s a whole team going, I think they might be renting a van/small bus to shuttle us around, so I’ll be stuck in a confined space with coworkers (not especially friendly ones) for a long time. We’re also visiting a construction site so access to bathrooms may be limited to Porto-potties which I generally avoid like the plague. I also have social anxiety (if you couldn’t tell already 🫠) so this whole situation was never ideal to begin with.


How I see it, I can either:

- as my Dr. (who is great) to stay on .25 for another month. I’m okay with the “setback” if it keeps me from publicly humiliating myself or tanking in front of the CEO and other higher ups.

- Skip the dose that Friday and start .5 the week after, although I think this would make side effects worse when I start up again because of the lower amount of wegovy in my system at the time? Please correct me if I’m wrong!

- Is there another option besides not going or bringing a bag of meds I’ve never taken before to combat symptoms I’ve never experienced? I don’t like the unknowns and don’t completely trust myself with reading my body and timing pills. I’m very open to anything this community would have to suggest!


I’ve only had very mild nausea on .25  and lost about 4lbs in my first week. Nothing too dramatic as my SW was 185 (CW 181) I’m 38F and 5’4”. Food noise has never been an issue for me and most of my life I was a healthy athletic 130-140lbs although at the time I thought I was fat and hated all photos. Looking back, I really really really wish I was kinder to mysef. I was diagnosed with Graves’ Disease 4 years ago and the medication- methimazole- made me gain about 10 lbs almost overnight whenever my dosage changed (which was every few months). The highest was 210lbs last year but as my levels finally stabilized, the weight naturally came down to about 185 where it plateaued leaving me pre-diabetic and little appetite even before Wegovy. I never thought I’d hope to get back to that former version of myself who I spent years being so cruel to… I’ve clawed my way back onto a promising career path after being debilitatingly sick for so long and I’m terrified I might sabotage it all because of Wegovy.

Again, any suggestions, similar experiences, or words of support are so appreciated!! I haven’t told anyone in my life about this, so it’s feeling like a lonely road. I’m grateful for you all!",2024-06-30,5,9,Wegovy

When my doctor put me on semaglutide, I felt like I was finally going to be happy hoping to see a physical change in my body. So, after losing 11 pounds on a cal deficit and working out, i started wegovy May 10th for PCOS, insulin resistance, and possibly pre-diabetes. After 7 weeks on wegovy, I only lost 8 pounds. I am someone who worries a lot and I watch a lot of influencers on semaglutide, but they’re taking up to 12.5-15 mg on mounjaro or zepbound, while wegovy’s max is 2.4 mg. I am not losing much weight on 0.5 mg of wegovy and I am hoping to see physical results soon, I am hoping to use those dosages but i don’t know if they’re for me.

some questions i have are

why does wegovy only go up to 2.4 mg?

 Is wegovy a “starter” semaglutide? and if so, will my doctor switch me to zepbound/mounjaro? 

Is weight loss guaranteed with wegovy if I check off the “list” of needing it?

1drwemc,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Side Effect. I took my second 0.5mg dose about 33 hours ago (this is my sixth weekly dose - 4 0.25mg doses + 1 other 0.5mg dose).

I have POTS.  I used to never feel PVCs (skipped beats), but I have for the past couple years.

I am fairly confident that the buildup of Wegovy is making my heart go nuts with PVCs.  They are common and they are intense - each one scares the crap out of me.

Here’s why I think it’s the Wegovy:
- With the FIRST 0.5mg dose, after around 20ish hours I had zero appetite.  For the majority of the day following the day I injected it, it seemed to be doing what it was meant to do.  I woke up the following morning and the cravings had returned, just as strong as before.  This is all to say that it seems that the drug did have an effect on me 20 hours after I took it.  
- The first few nights last week (for some reason purely at night), I had was having intense POTS flare-ups with increased PVCs.  This died down after around 5 days of my having taken the first 0.5mg dose.
- About 20 hours after taking the second 0.5mg dose, I began experiencing PVCs more frequently and of higher intensity than I ever have.  Usually I only get them once per day; I have been getting them literally once every couple of minutes, and they feel much scarier than normal.  I am taking 0.5mg propanolol every few hours and it’s completely wiping them out—but once it wears off, they’re back in full force. 

Anyone else experience this?  (Btw, I’ve messaged my doctor about this AND PVCs generally aren’t harmful.)",2024-06-30,0,4,Wegovy

Eventually, I got hurt in an accident and started gaining weight once I couldn't move quite as well as I used to.  Got divorced a couple months before covid hit and those times crystallized a lot of bad habits and I gained like 60 pounds until earlier this year.

I join Weight Watchers and I see they have a clinic where they'll prescribe you this stuff and I thought, ""Screw it, what have I got to lose?""  Anyhow, it's helped me clean up my eating.  I did lose 2 pounds before starting Wegovy, so I was headed on the right track, but I definitely think it's helped me simply by having a written record of what I'm eating and my own internal drive of trying to ""win"" my day by not going over in points (won every day so far).

Anyhow, I also read on here before I started that I can either get constipated or diarrhea.  I wish I was one of the ones that gets diarrhea, because I hate being stopped up.

I'm nervous about jumping into this process, and I've found that being prepared and informed eases my anxious thoughts. I'm looking for some of your best pieces of advice. They can revolve around injections, snacks, exercise, avoiding side effects, etc.

I haven’t started my first dose yet, it’s currently sitting in my fridge while I took a few days to get everything, however, I have a problem. I just, very unexpectedly, purchased my wedding dress for next year. I am happy with how I look in it and I know that they really can only take in up to two sizes.

 My current concern is losing too much pre wedding and having it mess up my dream dress. I’m going to talk to my doctor about it but my current thought, and please feel free to correct me, is that I’ll take it until I go down two sizes and then go to maintenance dose until the wedding day, where I’ll then titrate up?

1dropts,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Rapid weight loss = more likely to gain to back? . I have no evidence to support this, but I wonder if individuals who have extreme weight loss in a short period of time are setting themselves up for failure if the medication becomes unavailable to them.  

I've been on this medication since March, and have lost about a pound a week, even though my appetite has been curbed significantly.  But, I make myself take in calories bc first, I think it's a bad idea to eat only 500 calories a day (which would be easy to do) and second, I want the chance to gradually change my eating habits so if I can't take the medicine anymore, I'll have a fighting chance to keep the weight off without it. 

That makes me wonder about folks who had less than 100 lbs to lose but are dropping 15 lbs a month.  I am happy for them but also concerned that their progress is one insurance company decision away from being completely derailed and they have no plan in place on how to cope bc their only strategy is to eat a few hundred calories. We all know it's about what you eat, as well as how much of it you're eating.  Thoughts? 

TLDR: Are the people dropping massive amounts of weight by solely relying on the medication more likely to put it back on bc they aren't changing their eating habits?",2024-06-30,3,21,GLP-1

i took a blood test which showed no pregnancy and also 5 negative urine tests. But i cant get peace that it is correct before i have my period back.

Tomorrow I take my eighth and final dose of the .25 pen, and the numbers kind of speak for themselves. This dosage has beef far and away more effective than I had any right to hope for, and I officially crossed the 30lbs lost mark yesterday. 

The last week has been really difficult, as my tolerance for the .25 grows. I'm basically on my own now, having all the food noise back, morning appetites, and midnight cravings. But, thanks to my change in habits, my meticulous tracking of calories, my meal preparation, and the permission to forgive myself and do better tomorrow when I eat too much, I have been able to keep on keeping on! 

There have been fits and starts. It took a while to reach the 20lb mark, and then I kind of hit a wall. No gains, but definitely a week or so where the scale didn't move. Not coincidentally, that was around when the drug began to lose its effectiveness and I found my caloric intake rising slowly. I also had a few cheat meals around that time -- which isn't really something you can do when the drug is working. 

So it's at that point where my usefulness as an example for others on the journey to follow ends, lol. I have ramped my weight loss back up by actively resisting urges, as well as making my own meals as much as possible, so I know exactly what is going into my body. This willpower I have now is only possible because of the progress I've made from Wegovy. 

But willpower is temporary. This next week will be a huge test for me. If the idea of eating poorly is so antithetical to how I live now that I can't help but resist it, then I'm winning. If not...well, hopefully my .5 is in stock!",2024-07-31,6,0,Wegovy

1egwsvm,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Losing inches, but not weight . I am 6 weeks in, still on 0.25, as my side effects were brutal to start with, and I think it's still working.

I haven't been hungry in 6 weeks. I haven't had a single snack in 6 weeks. I have zero cravings, food is an absolute chore.

First 4 weeks I was trying the whole ""intuitive eating"", and lived off watermelon and Greek yogurt. I lost 8kg in those 4 weeks. I decided it is not healthy or sustainable, so I started weighing and logging everything that goes into my mouth, along with actually putting food in my mouth. My TDEE is 1995, and I am barely making it to 1000 on most days. I am just NOT hungry, I ACTIVELY do not want food, and spend my evenings nursing chicken breast to get some protein in.

I have not lost any weight in the past 2 weeks. I keep hovering between 95-93kg, depending on the time of the day. I have however lost 5 inches from my waist and 6 from my hips. Not a clue HOW.

Here's possible options, and I'd like to hear your opinions:


1. My kitchen scale is broken / my fitness pal is lying to me / I am stupid

I barely eat, weigh and log everything, down to a single cucumber slice. If I use oil for cooking I will weigh the bottle before and after. If buttering bread I will weigh the butter dish AND the slice of bread before and after the action to make sure it's accurate. Hell, I even weigh and log my herbs! 

2. My human scale is broken

Two weeks of no weight loss on 1000 calories is impossible, when my weight is around 95-93kg.

3. I am a special snowflake who by magic defies laws of physics.

I do not exercise. None, nada. No excuses here, I just don't. So I cannot possibly be muscle gain and fat loss. 

4. I am constipated AF.

Well...for me, at least.

But I'm also afraid to stop taking it because in the back of my mind, I have FOMO.

I have been consistent about losing weight (again), to this time, keep the excessive weight off for good.

I have been training myself to use the awesome tools of intermittent fasting, consuming a high protein - low carb diet with walking and exercise.
I have lost 30 lbs since April.
One and a half of those months, I have also been on Wegovy, but not consistently.

The thing is, I lost 15 of those pounds before my 1st injection.
I started with the lowest dosage, taking it for 1 month. I continued to lose weight. I then missed two weeks because my doc failed to send my refill or script for the next or higher dosage to the pharmacy. 
I lost only about 3 or 4 lbs during those two weeks.

I have been on the next level of injections for 2 1/2 weeks and have only lost about 4 lbs. Granted, I've cut back on the fasting, but still eating virtually no junk and eating with increased levels of protein.

I don't have really bad cravings or food noise, but I really never have.

So, I question why I should go to the doctor tomorrow to be evaluated for the next dosage hoping those will finally kick me into gear.

Mind you, during month one of injections, I only felt nauseous during the first day. I felt no other difference in my body or mind.
The first two weeks of this .5 injections, I felt nothing injecting into my stomach. I then read where you should switch up the injection area. I injected my thigh on this third week, and BOY am I having side effects. 
I have been queasy for days, my period started early, I have a constant headache and I don't feel that my appetite is suppressed. So why should I endure this???

I really don't know if this life is for me, but I NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT!

I'm now researching fat burners to try instead.

1egsjsw,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Cut My Hair Off -- Hair Loss. I got my hair cut yesterday. It was maybe 3 inches below my shoulders and I cut it to a chin length bob.

It was falling out. Like really falling out. Having long hair all over the place was annoying, but the worst part was that when a lot of hair is falling out, if you have a lot of long hair, it causes terrible tangles. My hair, which I take great care of, was snarling up like crazy to the extent that I couldn't deal with it. So I just went to the salon and had it cut off. It was kind of a weird experience because she washed my hair and then went to comb it and it was snarled up (even though I'd combed it free of tangles before I left for the salon) and she had to set down the comb and pick up a de-tangler brush -- which promptly filled up with a huge amount of hair. She showed it to me and asked if I new I had hair loss. I told her it was medication related and that's why I was cutting it off and left it at that. She was super gentle and nice to me after that, I think she thought it was chemo or something. I don't know. 

The doctor said it's more likely the weight loss than a separate side effect from Wegovy. I don't know. I've lost about 19 pounds in 12 or so weeks. That is a little over 1.5 lbs a week. She was concerned that I'm not eating enough, so now I'm tracking calories and protein. We'll see if that helps. 

I did have hair fall out as a result of weight loss once before, but that was after about a year and a half on WW, losing 1-2lbs a week -- that time the doctor said it was because the calorie deficit had been for over a year. This has been only 11 weeks.

I’ve been on Wegovy since early April. After one month on .25 and two and a half months on .5, I just moved up to 1 mg last week.

1eglybq,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Month 1 - Food Aversions n New Loves. So I have completed my first month of Wegovy - just took my first .5 shot on Monday and here is what I have gleaned so far…

I can no longer stomach more than 2 pieces of bacon at a time. Unheard of insanity. I am a bacon hoover. Alas, not anymore.

The meat section of any grocery store - especially BJ’s as I walked thru to get protein shakes - makes me full on nauseated. 

I no longer crave cupcakes or cake or chocolate chip cookies - which were my all time fav. Who the frick am I? 

I can no longer drink Mexican Coca Cola or any soda of any kind. 

I went to Five Guys for lunch and only ate 1/3 of a kids cheeseburger and maybe 10 fries. That I kind of enjoyed because I was able to indulge a craving but not make myself sick. 

Fairlife chocolate protein shakes (26g and 30g) over ice are my new favorite drinks. It is like iced chocolate milk. I drink them 3x’s a day. 

Watermelon for nausea and electrolytes for headaches are my daily go-to’s.

Unreal chocolate and coconut mini bars are lovely and the coconut is fiber so win-win. 

Outer aisle cauliflower sandwich thins make perfect pizza crusts and they are full of fiber so again win-win. 

The LoseIt app (or any tracking app) is key to helping me lose weight. I had no idea how many calories I was consuming prior. I can have 28 almonds in a serving…I would have 3X that amount as a snack. Holy cripes tracking calories - yeah I know - logical and not new science - I just now fully see the importance - for keeping myself in check and accountable. 

Also, I still love food. I see recipes and my mouth still waters and I know I can have them but in moderation. Nothing is truly off limits. This is a game changer. 

For reference - F/over 50 (yikes) - 13.9lbs down down as of last week. First week was a big loss of 7lb and I know that was mostly all water - I was bloated with inflammation like a tick and now I feel like I am deflating. It is such a wonderful feeling.

**(1)** When food is consumed, it begins to break down in the stomach and small intestine.  
**(2)** The breakdown of food, particularly carbs, leads to an increase in blood glucose levels.  
**(3)** Cells in the small intestine respond by secreting the hormone GLP-1.  
**(4)** GLP-1 travels through the bloodstream and binds to GLP-1 receptors on the pancreas, which causes pancreas to produce insulin. Insulin then lowers blood glucose.  
**(5)** Insulin promotes the uptake of glucose by tissues, especially muscle and fat cells, for energy use or storage. In the liver, insulin promotes the conversion of glucose into glycogen for storage. All of this leads to a decrease in blood glucose levels.

It's been quite the journey!

Started 1.7mg earlier this week. Experiencing some nausea but feel I am generally managing to tolerate this dosage well. Appetite is very much suppressed, and I feel very full even with small meals. At this stage, I don't think I can or want to increase the dosage any further.

What's the consensus on this? Do people tend to stick with the dose that works for them and is best tolerated? 

Thinking long-term, I'm a bit anxious about discontinuing Wegovy, as it has really helped curb my old bad eating habits. I absolutely never thought this would work for me. As my weight crept up during the pandemic and thereafter, I was in a rut and felt self-conscious about my weight and appearance, to the point I was reluctant to socialise and would avoid being in photos with family and friends. I can totally appreciate and see a difference in my appearance when looking back at old photos, and people at work have mentioned it.

I have one more shot of 1.7 and haven’t lost anything in 3 weeks, so planned to go up to 2.4 after that.  I don’t want to give up because this has been a miracle shot for me and such a good thing, but it’s frustrating when I am having trouble functioning. 😩",2024-09-01,3,15,Wegovy

I just took my first dose (.25) a few days ago on Thursday and, as excited and hopeful as I am, the side effects have hit me pretty hard. I'm finding that heavily seasoned foods like I normally want to eat are not sitting well and have gotten sick in the mornings. 

What have y'all found prevents the nausea and sickness? I want to give this a really good try, but I've been very uncomfortable and I've had a very hard time getting more than 500-800 calories the last few days.

- Definitely noticed a reduction in hunger feeling but could still eat if I wanted to (warning for fellow emotional eaters, so make sure you have other coping mechanisms as the urge to comfort eat is still there in my opinion)

- I didn't experience any really bad side effects, just some mild nausea and reduction in frequency to go but not full on constipation (from two trips a day down to one). I definitely felt hormonally off to the point I thought I may have been pregnant as I also experienced the above when pregnant with my boy. Speaking of which, weird side effect I was not expecting: my menstruation cycle is late. Definitely not pregnant. Four tests can confirm and this is the only change this month.

Been on Ozempic and then Wegovy since Dec 18th 2023. I've lost 43 pounds, however the last couple of months I've just been losing and gaining the same 3 pounds. It's almost like the 1mg is acting as a maintenance, which I would be perfectly okay with, but I'm trying to lose 60 pounds total. 
So, I've decided to go up to 1.7mg on Monday (I'm currently at 1mg). 

Anyone have any experience with stalls and then going up to 1.7mg?

I'm only lightly active, I walk twice a day, each walk is a little over 1km long (I think that's 3/4 of a mile) 

My portions are still small, I can't eat nearly what I used to but I will admit, my evening snacking has returned.

Current weight : 128.6 lbs

Height : 5'0 
Weight loss : 20.5 lbs 
Weekly average : 1.7 lbs

11 weeks down. Started my 12th week on Thursday night. 
This was my last injection of 1.7, and I move up to 2.4 next Thursday. 

I have FINALLY experienced my first real side-effect on Wegovy! I was eating a chopped salad last night, and less than halfway through the bowl, I noticed a sense of fullness. 

There was NO way I was actually getting full. I had a super busy day and only managed one decaf coffee and water up until dinner. 

But there I was eating my salad, and I sensed fullness. The salad had: cucumbers, tomatoes, celery, carrot, a hard boiled egg, and diced chicken and ham (kind of a chef salad). I hadn't even made it to the egg yet, but I was getting full. The chicken and ham were left untouched. I could not force down any more food, and my first thought was that I must be coming down with something. I must be getting sick. 

I went to bed. Woke up today and my stomach is growling with hunger. I need to freaking eat! I opened my fridge full of food, and nothing looks particularly tempting. I closed it, and now I'm laying in bed watching Netflix. I need to eat! I ate almost nothing yesterday. 

And then suddenly it dawned on me...could this be Wegovy? Ever since starting these meds, I haven't had any appetite suppression or food aversion. NONE. I can eat what I want and how much I want. I stay on Wegovy because it gives me a lot more willpower to make healthy choices and not overeat. 

I still think this is some weird fluke and by tonight, I'll be raiding my fridge in a frenzy. But for a small moment, eating that salad yesterday, I think I felt for the first time what others talk about when they say they can't finish their meals. It was mind-blowing. I'm a plate FINISHER. I don't LEAVE food. 

Anyhoo, that was weird. I'm sure it won't last.

1f5pavi,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Progress and Tips. Fellow Wegovy friends, I am 6 weeks in and am now down 12 pounds.  I've lost an average of 2 pounds a week.  I posted a longer post a few days ago about how carb cycling as a meal plan has helped me so much. I've had about a week where I didn't lose anything and the process of carb cycling reminded me that that happens and how to mix things up. I followed the plan and I lost weight again the next week and was able to keep my average of 2 pounds per week going.

So, for those who are at a plateau, remember that it happens.  Don't lose hope. Remember to eat your minimum calories per day (1200 for women and 1500 for men).  

When it feels like you can't eat anything because you're full, try drinking your calories. The premade Slim Fast shakes are actually tasty. I get the ones with high protein and even the ones that are coffee flavors with caffeine have high protein. They have around 200 calories and vitamins and minerals.  They can be pricey, but they cost less than the sugary coffee I was getting pretty much every day prior to starting Wegovy.  I buy the 8 pack or 12 pack of different flavors at my local Meijer and they equal about $2 per bottle.

Drinkable Greek yogurts are also high in protein and low calories. I see some posts about people not feeling that they can eat enough and are maybe not eating enough calories. I've found that I can drink a Slim Fast or Greek Yogurt drink to get to my minimum calories without feeling full.

So, drink your calories and get some nutrients at the same time when you feel like you can't eat anymore. Eating enough calories helps with the weight loss.

Have a great week, everyone!",2024-08-31,5,4,Wegovy

1f5ni0e,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Semaglutide has been healing my relationship with food. I’ve been chubby for as long I can remember. Not fat, but uncomfortably overweight for a girl in South Korea. For almost all of my life, I believed I had no one to blame but myself for my extra pounds. I went to diet clinics, I got personal training sessions, I did progressive overload / strength training at the gym 2-4 times a week, and in general I was a pretty active person. What I couldn’t control was my appetite —- I’ve always had a larger appetite than my peers and even than my parents. 

When people said “I was so busy today, I forgot to eat.” That was just downright unbelievable to me. For me, eating the recommended amount to MAINTAIN my weight was an all-day battle. I almost never felt satiated and hunger was my default mode. 

I got prescribed semaglutide 6 weeks ago and I’ve had some ups and downs (Spent a good 12 hours puking up my dinner in one instance) but what’s amazed me the most is how much I don’t have to think about food any more! I eat lunch when noon rolls around, eat dinner when dinner time comes around, but I’m no longer thinking about my next meal 24/7. My hunger hasn’t disappeared, but it’s manageable — I imagine this is what “normal” people feel. 

I’ve lost 5 pounds in 6 weeks without even trying. Remember, I’ve always been an active person. I’ve been eating the same type of food as I always have, been going to the gym as often as I usually do, pretty much nothing in my lifestyle has changed except for the fact that my hunger / appetite is now something I don’t have to actively manage. I feel like I had to employ 100% willpower over my food intake prior to semaglutide, and now it’s just effortless. 

What’s more, I realize I’m being kinder to myself. I thought my appetite / relationship with food was a “me” problem — that I simply lacked the willpower to control myself. But what I’m starting to suspect is that it wasn’t a willpower issue. When you have fewer cravings, you don’t need to flex your willpower. I wonder if what I’m currently feeling is what “normal” people go through every day.

I’m getting close to no longer being in the “Obese” range of the BMI scale, and I’m wonder when Asda will no longer approve me for Wegovy. 
On their website it says you must be over 30 on the BMI scale for approval, but not that they’ll necessarily take it away once you’re under?

For myself however, Wegovy has not been effective for pretty much anything besides maybe maintaining weight which is not my goal right now.  

I had side effects (stomach pain, vomiting) at first when the doses were low but I’ve been on the max 2.4 dose for a little over a year now with literally zero weight loss. Now I know it’s not a miracle drug and I’ve been trying to stick to a better eating plan but I’ve found that Wegovy isn’t really curbing my appetite at all. It feels as if it isn’t really doing much of anything at all. 

I realize that Wegovy won’t work for everyone but my question is where do I go from here?  Do I continue with Wegovy and hope it eventually works?  Seems highly unlikely. Is there another drug that I could switch to so that I could see if it worked better? Just so frustrated.  For reference I’m a 6’2” male and weigh 275lbs.

Hello everyone! After looking through this subreddit for a while, I have decided to post since I don't notice people who have started as heavy as I am.   
My weight loss journey started almost 2 years ago on Phentermine. I initially did really well on that, lost around 80-90 lbs over 6 months. Then I had a lot of chronic pain flair up, which led me back to my highest weight again (and higher). I have been managing my pain over the last year, and it's still bad but noticeably better than when I started. Now I am on track for bariatric surgery at the end of this year (est Dec) and I need to get into this.   
I attempted to get this type of shot a while ago, but UHC doesn't cover it. However, I have been using Medi-Cal as a secondary for about 6 months, and it covers it completely. I have it in my fridge and I start it tomorrow. I plan to make Saturday my shot day since I am usually the least busy on those days. Do you know if there is any advice you all have for me? I know I need to stop my phentermine before starting the shot, I think. I have also been in Physical Therapy for the past month working on learning how to move for my pained body. I have a gym membership where I plan to take classes. The bain of my existence in this journey is food. I have a history of disordered eating and I struggle with counting calories due to becoming compulsively obsessed with it to a fault. What do you all recommend for good, keeping track of it? Are there any protein powders or bars you all lean to?   
Basically, any advice would be extremely helpful. I know I can do this, and that I need to do this. Eventually, I need to take starting pictures as well.

1ft7svl,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Manufactured shortage?. Is the semaglutide/Ozempic/Wegovy/etc shortage manufactured? I have seen a strong push for it on three different telehealth platforms that asked if I was interested in getting Wegovy or Ozempic as part of the generic questions before even getting to my health info and name. Also, last week my GP made an aggressive push for me to get on Ozempic despite my labs being within normal limits and my diet and exercise and current meds doing just fine for me. I told him under no uncertain terms did I want that stuff. And he sat there and gaslit me and tried to argue with me for 5 minutes, making a strong push for me to get on it. He wasnt asking he was TELLING me and I just folded my arms and just kept repeating ""No,no,no,no"" no matter what he said or asked to bait me with.

I had a friend that had the hardest time getting it and she told me it is hard to get on it and that there is a shortage. She wanted it so bad and her doc denied her and she found some other way to get it. Meanwhile, I absolutely dont want any part of it and it seems like it is basically thrown at me. I dont believe the shortage is real. I believe the greedy pharmaceutical companies behind these drugs are manufacturing a fake shortage. 

And before anyone jumps me for not wanting any part of semaglutides like Wegovy and Ozempic - I do not care if people are taking drugs to lose weight, gain muscle or enhance their performance. I DO NOT think it is cheating. Having said that, I personally do not touch the stuff due to seeing what it has done to others and the numerous health risks involved. I understand you and a zillion others may do just fine on these things with absolutely zero side effects/consequences, but the benefits vs risks for me personally are not worth it. 

I am just wondering if others have had similar experiences. I see the Ozempic and Wegovy commercials heavily pumped on the tv screens at the gym, right after the pizza/hamburger/ food commercials over and over. There is definitely a concerted push for these drugs and manufacturers like Novo of Ozempic are raking in more money than the entire country's economy is worth in their country of origin. It costs them 1 to 5 dollars per dose to make but they sell it to the US for minimum of $925 per dose. The greed and insanity is real. The drug companies are spending billions on wining and dining physicians in order to get them to prescribe it to as many people as they can.

So has anyone else had this stuff thrown at them like this? I dont believe the shortages are organic. I think they are faked by the drug companies to induce more of a frenzy to get more people on it.",2024-09-30,0,3,Both

My doctor knew and said to got up to the 1.7 after 4 weeks on 1 so I did and the side effects worsened. 

My gas pains were so bad for 2 days about 2 days after injection, usually in the middle of the night, I was lying on the floor in the fetal position. Occasionally the pain was so bad it made me vomit which was gross cos it was vomiting and burping at the same time, but offered relief. No OTC helps and the only thing that does is a liquid diet which isn’t sustainable. The days when the pain is the worst I can’t function but I have 2 kids and I’m the school run parent so it’s not like I can just lay in bed. I haven’t even been able to start working out because my stomach is so raw and sore 80% of the time that the 20% of the time I’m fine I’m playing catch up with the house from being prone in bed.

About three shots into the .5 dose, I began to have a very weird sensation in my throat (Globus sensation) that something was stuck in it. It would come on very randomly and began to worry me, so I went to online urgent care and was told that it was probably reflux and given omeprazole. However, I never had any heartburn, so I was confused by that diagnosis. 

  
A few days after taking the omeprazole, the globus sensation went away, but I began to experience a very intense chest pain (sometimes dull and sometimes sharp). It is now about a week and a half later, and this chest pain has gotten worse and much more frequent. I even went to the ER two times because it was so intense that I thought I was having cardiac issues, however, they told me my heart and lungs were healthy and also suggested an acid reflux/GI issue.  I stopped taking Wegovy also a week and a half ago when the chest pain got bad, but I was curious to whether anyone else has experienced this. The pain is almost debilitating, and when it is occurring, it is all I can think about, and when it is not occurring, I am just thinking of the next time it will happen.

however everytime school started the binges happened. im talking large pizzas almost everyday, spamming orange juice (orange juice is good but the sugar intake wasnt) stopped working out and eventually in august 2023 started wegovy at 288.8. i did the bike again started out down 10lbs again then college started. at this point even before the wegovy i slowed down on the pizza since at the time i didnt eat it since like november 2020. i at between 1-2 times a day and that continued with wegovy but the workouts didnt. 

i know exactly why i stopped the workouts tho. i enjoyed building up the sweat and taking the shower after but the seat was wildy uncomfortable to sit on for 30 minutes even when i lowered the time to 25 it was still painful. and that honestly fueled my excuse to basically just be lazy with the workouts. i havent touched the bike since maybe december and now the living room is a mess so i barely even go in there unless the router is acting up. anyways, im now down 64.2lbs if my math is correct at 224.6 today. i wish i wasnt lazy and the seat after getting padding still wasnt like seating on metal, becuz i believe i coulda made it to my target of the 180s but thats my fault in the end. im just happy to finally see the 220s of my covid start weight. sorry for the essay lol

I went for a long hike with some friends and I was struggling with caloric intake. It was a tough hike and I should have been taking in ~100 calories an hour to keep up and also have a lunch. When we got to the top, my stomach was fill from the steady intake of snacks and I just couldn’t even force myself to eat my lunch.

I know the drugs slow down the processing so we feel full longer. But this made me feel like I was continually chasing the calories I needed for the hike.

Started Wegovy December 2023. I titrated up at the normal schedule and have been on 2.4 since May. I have had an amazing experience so far, I would describe it as basically textbook. I lost .5-1 pound a week while I titrated up, and then 2 pounds a week since starting 2.4. The expected digestive problems with diarrhea and constipation as I went up and figured things out but smooth sailing for months now.

But about six weeks ago, I basically stopped losing weight, and more importantly to me, the food noise started coming back. At first I thought i thought I had hit a plateau because I have weighed around 200 lbs many times before.

Then I thought maybe I needed to re-evaluate what I was eating, obviously as you lose weight your calories burned per day decreases. But really the bottom line is that I am having the food cravings and thoughts that I haven't had this whole time! I also had a huge decrease in impulse buying/shopping and that   urge is coming back too ☹️

English is not my first language so I want to say sorry in advance if I’m not able to express myself sufficiently. 

I’ve been using wegovy for about nine months now and I’ve lost 63 pounds. I started with 0,25 mg and then slowly increased my dosage up to 2,5 mg. Right now I am on 1 mg due to the cost of the medicine. 

My mother talked to her GP a couple of months ago and was prescribed Wegovy as well. She is now using 1 mg.

I have been getting bloodwork done yearly ever since my mom was diagnosed with Graves’ and had thyroid cancer to monitor my thyroid function. She had surgery done to her thyroid due to cancer. Additionally, she had to have surgery done twice to her eye because of a gland behind her eye was pushing her eyeball causing her to have this typical Graves’ staring eyes. 

Main point: 
After I’ve been using Wegovy for nine months, I had bloodwork done again. This time, for the first time in my life, it showed signs of hyperthyroidism. 

Moreover, after my mother started on Wegovy a couple of months back, the very same eye she had surgery on is starting to bulge out again and she has signs of hyperthyroidism and has been adjusting her medication due to it. 

Are there any of you that has the same experience as us? I’m not sure wether it is due to the Wegovy medication or not, but since we both have the experience at the same time, I am genuinely starting to wonder if it has something to do with it. 

Thank you in advance.

I had an infected deep cyst in a different part of my back about ten years ago, if it matters. I had to get that one drained. It's entirely possible that there have been others back there, buried so deep under fat that I didn't even know they existed.",2024-11-01,0,1,Wegovy

1ggciu9,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Question about Wegovy with a family history of thyroid cancer. Hello,

I posted this over at r/Ask Docs but it had no responses. I thought someone here might be able to help. 

I’ve been on Wegovy for five weeks now and it’s been pretty life changing so far. I’m down 6 kgs and my relationship with food has already improved so much. No side effects either. However, I have concerns regarding a family history of thyroid cancer.

A few years ago, at around 80 years old, my grandmother had a ‘hot nodule.’ I’ve attempted to get as much information from her as I can but all she could tell me was she had “a hot spot on her thyroid - a growth on her goiter”. She was given some kind of radioactive tablet which she took and had to isolate for three days. She then had normal blood tests afterwards and her ‘reading went up’ and now all bloods are good and she’s had to have it checked every so often. She couldn’t tell me the name of the cancer, only that it was a hot nodule. 

From what I’ve read online, it seems only a specific type of thyroid cancer is of concern “medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or if you have an endocrine system condition called Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).” 

I read online that MTC isn’t responsive to radioactive tablet treatments, which put my mind at ease a little that she was treated for a different type but I’m not sure. Is there enough information from my grandmother to know if her type was MTC? My prescribing doctor didn’t ask about family history of thyroid cancer at all so I’m not sure how concerned I need to be.

Thanks!",2024-10-31,1,1,Wegovy

I was at 188 pounds in May. I'm 5'4 (34F). I lost 40 pounds in 4 months and was super happy! I was still able to eat food I like but a LOT less of it. This means I still have candy, dessert, and yummy foods. Just a lot less. If I have sweets then that is an entire meal and I only had about 1200 Cals per day. Some days it was 600 calories or even nothing. Well now it's not like that anymore. I'm at 2.4 mg and I'm just eating crap but still my Cals are a lot less but I'm still eating too much. Now I'm stuck at 148 pounds. 

Was it just because I was so overweight that I was able to eat crap, just less, and still lose weight? While now I weigh a lot less and it doesn't work that way anymore? I'm just disappointed. I think I need to buckle down and eat a lot better. No more gushers, cake that I made, and yummy food. Today I had an ice cream cone (300 Cals) gushers (80 cals) and cake and ice cream (400 Cals) and then I had a bite of chicken and some rice for dinner. Why am I doing this? It still puts my calories under 1200 but it's all crap. There is no way this is healthy. Any thoughts? I need to stop this. I'm scared I'm hurting my body. 

I do a lot of yard work and I'm literally painting my house all by myself. The outside. I've also planted over 5000 bulbs of flowers this summer. It helps with losing weight. I just need to know what I should do. I feel so dumb. Like I'm trying to lose weight but I just can't stop eating horrible food! It's not like I'm even hungry. But I feel like I need to eat something. I feel like my body is craving real food and I'm not giving it real food at all. I'm so not healthy.

Any thoughts? I get so many compliments and I almost feel like a scammer because I lost weight eating literal crap! That's not normal. I'm sorry. I know most people won't lose weight doing this so I don't want anyone thinking this is possible for them. I worked out a ton and my Cals were still very low. Ughhh... I just want to eat healthy and lose weight. I need to lose another 13 pounds to hit my goal by the summer. 2 pounds a month. That's it. Why can't I do this?!

I wanted to get opinions on a few things, I feel like I’m reverting back to the shit show that was about 4 weeks of my life. 

Initially doc started with .25, next .5, then 1.0. Phentermine has always been prescribed along with the Wegovy. I’m a little gun shy since at month 3 everything fell apart. I went hiking in MT and couldn’t make it up a pretty easy hike. I don’t eat much which is a problem but I don’t know how to battle food. I hate it and it makes me want to vomit. 

After that mess I stopped everything and reset for a few weeks, I started back about 4 weeks ago, started with .5 and no Phentermine, went great. Stepped it up to 1.0 again, no Phentermine and weight loss all but stalled. This week I am doing the 1.0 with Phentermine and I’m headed back into hell. Very tired, dizzy, no appetite and cannot eat. I’m surviving on Protein shakes.

I’m looking for real feedback from people who have gone through this.

Is it time to ripcord? Another combo of drugs? Advice on side effects? Food? Anything else? 

What I went through a month ago we all chalked up to my body getting used to the drugs. It was hell for about 3 weeks. So many things happened but we can’t trace it to one of these drugs. Or could it be that I’m poisoning myself by not crapping for a week? Or dehydration? Or a lack of nutrition? 

When I stand up I’m dizzy. Really bad burps, like from the bottom of my stomach, relief after one of these is about 2 minutes. Really tired. Dizzy eye sight, headaches. Did I say exhausted? Prior I had really bad vertigo and went to the hospital because I was such a mess.

1. Do not eat until your stomach is absolutely growling so loud another person in the room can hear it which means no snacking. The only exception is if you are sick eat as much as you need to. 

2. Small, very small, like 1/3 cup small portion sizes. It is not good to be constantly hungry you’ll get headaches and make yourself unwell but because whatever I eat vanishes in about an hour I need to eat super small meals to stop the growling stomach. 

For example: let’s say I go to a steak house for dinner with friends. I get a 8 oz steak, potatoes, and some vegetable. Eat about 2 oz of steak (it’s like 2 or 3 slices) a normal sized spoonful of potatoes or if it’s those small fingerling potatoes eat 1 and a spoonful of whatever the veggie is. Proceed to then not touch my food for the next hour before eating more! (Yes it will be cold food I box up in the next hour and it takes me the next 4 hours to finish the meal)

Could I keep eating? Hell yeah I could I am not full but whether I eat 2 oz of steak, a fingerling potato, a spoonful of veggie OR 8oz of steak, half the potato and veggie dish OR eating all of it my stomach will still be growling in. The. Next. Hour. I really wish insurance realized that something is wrong with some people and that they can benefit from being on this med forever. It is exhausting having to feed myself every hour.",2024-12-01,4,8,Wegovy

When I checked with Cigna my insurance it said I had no coverage. CVS tells me the price is over $1,100 and I asked why it isn't 650? Apparently my insurance provides some minimal coverage that makes it not qualified to drop down that low

I'm seriously considering starting on Wegovy. I'm going to see if I can get it covered first through my clinic, but I can also go private too. 

I'm 168cm and 115 kilos (so BMI 40), so I need to drop down to about 71 kilos minimum to be in my healthy range. I do regularly workout and train pole and aerials and am quite strong/flexible, but I want to take the next step in my journey and start the medication now that I've 2 years under my belt of consistent excersize with activities that I love, and feeling in a good place in that regard. 

I have hypothyroidism which has for years made weight loss very challenging even with good eating habits.  

I've been doing a lot of research but as someone who works in research, I also know how often clinical trials do not account for lived experience.

As such, what are the things that you recommend to do when starting this medication, to help with the side effects like dehydration, nausea, hair loss and bowel issues like constipation etc?

Some things I've picked up include:

* 3-4 litres water daily
* Electrolytes
* protein shake before injection to manage nausea
* ginger tablets/mint or ginger tea etc for nausea
* small portions/snacks throughout the day where manageable to help with nausea
* focus on lean proteins, vegetables and carbs, minimise greasy/overly fatty foods or high sugar, to minimise symptoms

1h3ce42,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Wegovy Success 1 month in with no bad side effects . 


I thought id share my experience as someone who has had no adverse side effects (so far) one month in as there appears to be an overwhelming majority of posts about terrible side effects when starting.

A bit of background:  Now, looking at me most people would not think “that persons overweight”, friends I’ve told about wegovy are shocked and curious as to why, as I don’t “look” overweight, but the scales don’t lie and neither did the heavy feeling (or tight pants).

I’m generally pretty healthy otherwise, although the last two years I’ve done minimal exercise.


Dose: I started in .25 and am about to take .5 tomorrow.

Weight: I started at 93kg, I’m now 83kg.

That’s 10kg lost in a month. 

I’ve coupled this with CrossFit 3x a week and walking every day.

For me, I’ve experienced minimal to no adverse side effects, the only time I ever feel nauseous is when I overeat something with lots of sugar (icecream for example) and that’s it. 

Generally, I take my shot on Monday morning and go about my week as normal.

The lack of appetite is pretty crazy, alongside the satiated feeling, but I’ve been tracking my calories as I want to still perform at the gym so am getting my protein.

What I’ve noticed apart from weight loss is the sense of control and understanding. I am re-baselining my relationship with food and how much of it I actually need to perform tasks.

I really believe this medicine is a tool to be used to realise the way we are eating, which for me at least was mindless, over-consuming, high calorie, high sugar and low protein. The society we live in currently is geared towards this so it makes sense we so many of us are in positions of food reliance and especially sugar / processed food reliance. 

This has really changed my perspective of what goes into my body and what my body needs to function.

long story short - this has worked for me, very quickly and I’m excited to reach my goal weight and set new habits and goals when I eventually go off it!

Good luck everyone!",2024-11-30,3,1,Wegovy

I’ve been on wegovy for almost six weeks now and have experienced ZERO nausea or side effects. I’ve been able to maintain my weight which is great, as I lost 10kg on my own since February with PCOS. However I haven’t lost any weight in 6 weeks. I eat in a calorie deficit and track my food. I find that wegovy hasn’t stopped any food noise, however it does curb my appetite. I’m still thinking about food constantly but not hungry and don’t have the urge to over do it. I’ve still binged here and there but nothing as bad as I have in the past.

I guess I’m just sharing this as I see so many results about dropping crazy amount of weight and I feel like I’m spending all of this money and not getting anything back. I’m eating within a big deficit, working out, minimum 10k steps and eat whole foods and I’m stuck. Was the journey this slow for anyone else? Should I just keep up these habits and be more patient til I get on a stronger dose? 

My doctor has prescribed me 1mg for the next two months and I also take ADHD medication, so appetite is curbed but food noise is still there. Just feeling a little bit stuck and adding PCOS challenges it’s hard to not feel like a failure :(",2024-11-30,7,6,Wegovy

I've only lost about 20 pounds, but my A1C went from 6.1 to 5.5--yay! I was really freaking out about having diabetes, so I'm glad I've dodged that bullet--for now at least.

My biggest issue is that I noticed my hematocrit levels were elevated both times. Normally I don't really look at my hematocrit because it's within normal range, but both blood tests since have been over 50%--the last one I can remember was 52%. I think my RBC was up slightly as well, which would make sense. My normal hematocrit levels are around 47-48%

But I've noticed that sometimes I just don't urinate that much. And it's not super dark or anything. And it's not every time. But I started tracking how much water I drink recently, and it's been very little. But my problem is I just don't feel like drinking water that much anymore. You know that feeling when you've had too much water, and it almost tastes bad in your mouth and your stomach feels full? That's how I feel drinking water.

The only way I've gotten around that is eating a piece of special dark chocolate, which makes me thirsty. And I know people will say ""you need to drink more water!"" But it's like suddenly unappetizing to do so.

Has anyone else experienced this? I noticed that this is tied to my higher than normal heart rate, because when you're dehydrated and your blood is thicker, your heart has to pump harder to move the blood, hence it speeds up how many times it pumps.

1h2ziob,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Weight loss Plateau . I’ve been in Wegovy since late April/early May 2024. I’ve lost about 30-35ish pounds. However, it seems that since late September, I’ve stalled. I have experienced some body recomposition, but that’s it. I am on the max dose at 2.4 and lead a very active lifestyle with cycling. I weight lift 1-2x a week - not nearly as much as I’d like and plan to make it 2-3x a week. 
What has everyone else done when they’ve plateaued? I’d like to hear more about how to get through this.

1h2z4fn,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Maintenance dose and stomach pain. I have been taking Wegovy for 16 months. I have lost 110 lbs and I’m at my goal weight. I titrated up according to manufacturer directions and went all the way to 2.4, I’m now on 1.7 and taking every 10-12 days. I’d like to move to 1.0 for maintenance but I can’t find it anywhere. 

I have almost constant, dull stomach pain. It’s not severe, but it’s very frequent. I also mostly have diarrhea instead of regular bowel movements. I’ve always had a terrible stomach but not this often. I did have my gallbladder out in 2023. I also had an upper GI endoscopy in 2023 where the didn’t find anything wrong. 

Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this being on Wegovy this long. I don’t know if it’s related or not. I worry that any doctor will just attribute my pain to Wegovy and take me off.

1h2ys5g,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Getting Approval/Eligibility when Prediabetic. I recently found out I am prediabetic (midrange between low-prediabetic levels and high pre-diabetic levels) after not being able to lose weight AT ALL for the last few years. It started about 3 1/2 years ago pretty slowly, and when I reigned it in and did what I normally have always done when I’ve needed to drop back down a few lbs and normalize, I’d lose it like I always did. I am 5’4,” petite, and a normal weight throughout my adult life has ranged from 108-130. I’ve always been a zero to size 4 at most. I am now 145. I can literally EAT NOTHING and I can’t drop the weight (and it’s all in a huge tire of blubber around my waist and distributed between what are now my two DD bra cups up from a B). Keto used to be my go-to. Nope. Calorie restriction. Nope. Nothing works. Unfortunately I’m also very sedentary due to several serious autoimmune illnesses. Yay. But I was sedentary for years and stayed below 125. I didn’t age anything 3 years ago, and it just keeps coming. 

I figured I had metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance, but was really upset with the prediabetes diagnosis. I already have multiple autoimmune conditions (including ones that cause weight gain), and I have plenty of reason to believe this actually may not be prediabetes type II, but actually a type of autoimmune diabetes, Latent Auroimmune Diabeties in Adults), I just haven’t gotten the antibody testing yet. I don’t know what that means for Wevovy or similar RX’s.

My BMI is 25.5, but all my weight is in my belly and looks almost freakish, I have prediabetes, and I’m pretty sure at least one of my cholesterol results were slightly off—I need to get the copy sent to me of the results.

Any chance to get these drugs without the hard BMI>27 rule with two other conditions or the straight BMI>30?",2024-11-29,0,15,GLP-1
1h2ye4d,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Federal employees: What's going on with BCBS in 2025? I'm getting conflicting information and need to know if I need to change insurance. . I found a few threads about this topic recently but the last one was 2 weeks old and I'm curious if anyone has some updated information. 

My wife happened to hear that Wegovy was going up in price with BCBS (we have Standard). I had no idea this was occuring. So I called BCBS and was told that, on the standard plan, it would cost me approximately $650 out of pocket in 2025. I also asked about the mail-order price I saw on their website ($125/84 day supply). **They said that mail-order will not be available for Wegovy.** I know there was a previous  thread that said mail-order would be available. I told them that I currently pay $25. They said that I should be paying over $300 and I should call my pharmacy to see how the price is $25.  

So I called my pharmacy. They said they don't have the 2025 pricing and can't get an estimate without new insurance. I asked how the price was getting to $25 so that I could see what the price would be with whatever coupon is that they are using. They said that they aren't applying a coupon so they aren't sure why the price is that low and suggested I call my insurance. When I told them I just called my insurance they suggested I call my agency. 

Anyway - I'm getting the run around. I'll call my agency on Monday but at this point I think I need to find another insurance carrier. Disappointing because I've had BCBS for literally my entire life and have otherwise been happy.

**A few questions:**

- Does anyone have any updated information from BCBS about Wegovy coverage?
- How is my prescription costing $25 without a coupon? 
- What coupons will be available in 2025 and will those coupons cover the cost of Wegovy?
- Which insurance is covering Wegovy at an affordable price in 2025?",2024-11-29,1,29,Wegovy

1h2wgx0,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"MHBP consumer? .  I’ve seen a lot of posts about people moving from BCBS to the MHBP standard plan but not many about the MHBP consumer plan.

Based on my review, wegovy would be $1,293 per month on the consumer plan but once the $2000 deductible is met, it drops to $200 per month (same as the standard plan). 

And since the consumer plan has an HSA ($1200), the functional deductible is really only $800 so would be met after one month of wegovy. 

Most other fees are much less on the consumer plan compared the standard plan (e.g, an MRI on the consumer plan is only $15 vs 10% on the standard plan, which could be ~$200).

Am I missing something? Is there a reason I haven’t seen more people talking about moving to the consumer plan?",2024-11-29,2,0,Wegovy

1h2vr35,reddit,r/WegovyWeightLoss,"Starting 1mg. Hi Guys! 

I started wegovy in the beginning of September. I was on the .25 for one month, then the .5 for two months. 

I was scared to increase because I get these sort of dizzy spells if I stand up too quickly or if I get out of breath. I feel like I’m going to pass out then I kind of just have to stop for a second and it goes away. I have lost about 15 pounds, but felt like the .5 wasn’t strong enough so I started the 1 mg today. I took it this morning around 9 AM and I am already feeling really crappy and nauseous. I am concerned about how this is going to go, and I do not want to stop taking the medication it really helps with the food noise and not over eating.
